# Notes

* Try writing very short pieces, a paragraph, a page, not complete
  stories. Just describe a certain scene, or put a character into a
  situation of some kind and tell what they do, what they feel.
* [...] you need to know where your story is going, in a general way,
  before you begin writing it. But I don’t advise thinking of the end
  of the story as a "target." You aren't shooting at something.
  You’re making something.
* How can you judge how well the first page of a story works until
  you've done a first draft of the whole story? There’s no way you
  can tell until the whole thing is, however roughly, there.

  And then, more often than not, you find the first page, the first
  several pages, are just throat-clearings. Necessary preliminaries.
  Clearing stuff out of the way. Circling around, nose to ground…
  till finally you pick up the scent and you're off into your story
  like a bloodhound on the track.

  So then when you revise you throw away the whole beginning.

  If you don't trust me, trust Chekhov. He said you can always throw
  away the first three pages of a first draft. I didn't believe him
  till I tried it.
