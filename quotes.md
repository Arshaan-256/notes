The most important thing I learned on productivity is this Alan Kay quite â€”
"Perspective is worth 80 IQ points." You could be the most productive person in
the world, but it won't make the slightest bit of difference if you're pointing
your talents in a direction that isn't useful to other people. If you're
talented, your gift is precious and your time is limited. Learn how to direct
your talents, it will be the most important thing you do.

I am not a Labor Leader; I do not want you to follow me or anyone else; if you
are looking for a Moses to lead you out of this capitalist wilderness, you will
stay right where you are. I would not lead you into the promised land if I
could, because if I led you in, some one else would lead you out. You must use
your heads as well as your hands, and get yourself out of your present
condition; as it is now the capitalists use your heads and your hands.

*Eugene Debs*

As quoted in "Life of Eugene V. Debs" by Stephen Marion Reynolds, in Debs : His
Life, Writings and Speeches (1908) edited by Bruce Rogers and Stephen Marion
Reynolds, p. 71
