The most important thing I learned on productivity is this Alan Kay quite â€” "Perspective
is worth 80 IQ points." You could be the most productive person in the world, but it won't
make the slightest bit of difference if you're pointing your talents in a direction that
isn't useful to other people. If you're talented, your gift is precious and your time is
limited. Learn how to direct your talents, it will be the most important thing you do.
