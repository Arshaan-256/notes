## Jonathan Swift's Religious Beliefs

*David Cody, Associate Professor of English, Hartwick College*

Swift was a clergyman, a member of the Church of Ireland, the Irish branch of
the Anglican Church; and as such he was a militant defender of his church (and
his own career prospects) in the face of the threats to its continued existence
posed by Roman Catholicism at home in Ireland (which was overwhelmingly
Catholic) and in England, where Swift and his peers saw the Catholics (and, at
the other religious and political extreme, the Dissenters) as threatening not
only the Anglican Church but the English Constitution.

Swift was ostensibly a conservative by nature: he instinctively sought stability
in religion as in politics, but stability which insured personal
freedoms. Indeed, so far as he was concerned, religion, morality, and politics
were inseparable: he consistently attacked theological attempts (even within
Anglicanism itself) to define and limit orthodoxy — attempts which, he felt, led
ultimately to anarchic dissent. The divisive tendencies of Mankind had, he
believed, over the centuries, promoted the general decay of Christianity itself,
which had lost its original clarity, simplicity, and coherence. The Truth had
been mishandled, corrupted, by men who had behaved like Yahoos. He adhered to
the tenets of the Anglican Church because he had been brought up to respect
them, because the Church of Ireland was the church of his social class, and
because his own ambitions were involved in its success, but also because he saw
the Church as a force for rationality and moderation; as occupying a perilous
middle ground between the opposing adherents of Rome and Geneva.

Underlying all of Swift's religious concerns, underlying his apparent
conservatism, which was really a form of radicalism, was his belief that in Man
God had created an animal which was not inherently rational but only capable, on
occasion, of behaving reasonably: only, as he put it, rationis capax. It is our
tendency to disappoint, in this respect, that he rages against: his works embody
his attempts to maintain order and reason in a world which tended toward chaos
and disorder, and he concerned himself more with the concrete social, political,
and moral aspects of human nature than with the abstractions of philosophy,
theology, and metaphysics.

## Alıntılar

* "Kanunlar örümcek ağına benzer. Onlar nasıl yalnız küçük sinekleri tutar da,
  arıları ve eşek arılarını yakalayamazlarsa, yasalar da aynı, küçük suçları
  tutar, fakat büyüklerini serbest bırakır."
* "without one word of cupid's darts,
  of killing eyes, or bleeding hearts;
  with friendship and esteem possessed,
  i ne'er admitted love a guest." [1]
* Violent friendship is much more lasting and as much engaging as violent love.

1. "cupid'in okları olmadan,
   öldürücü gözleri, ya da kanayan kalbi;
   dostluk ve saygı bana öylesine egemendi;
   aşkı hiçbir zaman konuk etmedim benliğime."
2. Siddetli (yoğun) bir dostluk, şiddetli bir aşktan daha uzun sürer ve insanı
   aşk kadar sarar.
