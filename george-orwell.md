## Notes

### Notes on Nationalism

* All nationalists have the power of not seeing resemblances between similar
  sets of facts. A British Tory will defend self-determination in Europe and
  oppose it in India with no feeling of inconsistency. Actions are held to be
  good or bad, not on their own merits, but according to who does them, and
  there is almost no kind of outrage — torture, the use of hostages, forced
  labour, mass deportations, imprisonment without trial, forgery,
  assassination, the bombing of civilians — which does not change its moral
  colour when it is committed by ‘our’ side. The Liberal News Chronicle
  published, as an example of shocking barbarity, photographs of Russians
  hanged by the Germans, and then a year or two later published with warm
  approval almost exactly similar photographs of Germans hanged by the
  Russians.

* Indifference to objective truth is encouraged by the sealing-off of one part
  of the world from another, which makes it harder and harder to discover what
  is actually happening. There can often be a genuine doubt about the most
  enormous events. For example, it is impossible to calculate within millions,
  perhaps even tens of millions, the number of deaths caused by the present
  war. The calamities that are constantly being reported — battles, massacres,
  famines, revolutions — tend to inspire in the average person a feeling of
  unreality. One has no way of verifying the facts, one is not even fully
  certain that they have happened, and one is always presented with totally
  different interpretations from different sources. What were the rights and
  wrongs of the Warsaw rising of August 1944? Is it true about the German gas
  ovens in Poland? Who was really to blame for the Bengal famine? Probably the
  truth is discoverable, but the facts will be so dishonestly set forth in
  almost any newspaper that the ordinary reader can be forgiven either for
  swallowing lies or failing to form an opinion. The general uncertainty as to
  what is really happening makes it easier to cling to lunatic beliefs. Since
  nothing is ever quite proved or disproved, the most unmistakable fact can be
  impudently denied.

* Some nationalists are not far from schizophrenia, living quite happily amid
  dreams of power and conquest which have no connection with the physical
  world.

* The world is tormented by innumerable delusions and hatreds which cut across
  one another in an extremely complex way, and some of the most sinister of
  them have not yet impinged on the European consciousness.

* All in all it is difficult not to feel that pacifism, as it appears among
  a section of the intelligentsia, is secretly inspired by an admiration for
  power and successful cruelty.

* (i) Anglophobia. Within the intelligentsia, a derisive and mildly hostile
  attitude towards Britain is more or less compulsory, but it is an unfaked
  emotion in many cases. During the war it was manifested in the defeatism of
  the intelligentsia, which persisted long after it had become clear that the
  Axis powers could not win. Many people were undisguisedly pleased when
  Singapore fell ore when the British were driven out of Greece, and there was
  a remarkable unwillingness to believe in good news, e.g. el Alamein, or the
  number of German planes shot down in the Battle of Britain. English left-wing
  intellectuals did not, of course, actually want the Germans or Japanese to
  win the war, but many of them could not help getting a certain kick out of
  seeing their own country humiliated, and wanted to feel that the final
  victory would be due to Russia, or perhaps America, and not to Britain. In
  foreign politics many intellectuals follow the principle that any faction
  backed by Britain must be in the wrong. As a result, ‘enlightened’ opinion is
  quite largely a mirror-image of Conservative policy. Anglophobia is always
  liable to reversal, hence that fairly common spectacle, the pacifist of one
  war who is a bellicist in the next.

* Monomania is not interesting, and the fact that no nationalist of the more
  bigoted kind can write a book which still seems worth reading after a lapse
  of years has a certain deodorising effect.

* The Eltons and Pritts and Coughlins, each of them simply an enormous mouth
  bellowing the same lie over and over again, are obviously extreme cases, but
  we deceive ourselves if we do not realise that we can all resemble them in
  unguarded moments. Let a certain note be struck, let this or that corn be
  trodden on — and it may be corn whose very existence has been unsuspected
  hitherto — and the most fair-minded and sweet-tempered person may suddenly be
  transformed into a vicious partisan, anxious only to ‘score’ over his
  adversary and indifferent as to how many lies he tells or how many logical
  errors he commits in doing so. Very few people are proof against lapses of
  this type. The Negro snubbed by a white woman, the Englishman who hears
  England ignorantly criticised by an American, the Catholic apologist reminded
  of the Spanish Armada, will all react in much the same way. One prod to the
  nerve of nationalism, and the intellectual decencies can vanish, the past can
  be altered, and the plainest facts can be denied.

* If one harbours anywhere in one's mind a nationalistic loyalty or hatred,
  certain facts, although in a sense known to be true, are inadmissible. Here
  are just a few examples. I list below five types of nationalist, and against
  each I append a fact which it is impossible for that type of nationalist to
  accept, even in his secret thoughts:

  BRITISH TORY: Britain will come out of this war with reduced power and
  prestige.

  COMMUNIST: If she had not been aided by Britain and America, Russia would
  have been defeated by Germany.

  IRISH NATIONALIST: Eire can only remain independent because of British
  protection.

  TROTSKYIST: The Stalin regime is accepted by the Russian masses.

  PACIFIST: Those who ‘abjure’ violence can only do so because others are
  committing violence on their behalf.

  All of these facts are grossly obvious if one's emotions do not happen to be
  involved: but to the kind of person named in each case they are also
  intolerable, and so they have to be denied, and false theories constructed
  upon their denial.

* The point is that as soon as fear, hatred, jealousy and power worship are
  involved, the sense of reality becomes unhinged. And, as I have pointed out
  already, the sense of right and wrong becomes unhinged also. There is no
  crime, absolutely none, that cannot be condoned when ‘our’ side commits it.
  Even if one does not deny that the crime has happened, even if one knows that
  it is exactly the same crime as one has condemned in some other case, even if
  one admits in an intellectual sense that it is unjustified — still one cannot
  feel that it is wrong. Loyalty is involved, and so pity ceases to function.

* It can be plausibly argued, for instance — it is even possibly true — that
  patriotism is an inoculation against nationalism, that monarchy is a guard
  against dictatorship, and that organised religion is a guard against
  superstition. Or again, it can be argued that no unbiased outlook is
  possible, that all creeds and causes involve the same lies, follies, and
  barbarities; and this is often advanced as a reason for keeping out of
  politics altogether. I do not accept this argument, if only because in the
  modern world no one describable as an intellectual can keep out of politics
  in the sense of not caring about them. I think one must engage in politics
  — using the word in a wide sense — and that one must have preferences: that
  is, one must recognise that some causes are objectively better than others,
  even if they are advanced by equally bad means.

* As for the nationalistic loves and hatreds that I have spoken of, they are
  part of the make-up of most of us, whether we like it or not. Whether it is
  possible to get rid of them I do not know, but I do believe that it is
  possible to struggle against them, and that this is essentially a moral
  effort. It is a question first of all of discovering what one really is, what
  one's own feelings really are, and then of making allowance for the
  inevitable bias. If you hate and fear Russia, if you are jealous of the
  wealth and power of America, if you despise Jews, if you have a sentiment of
  inferiority towards the British ruling class, you cannot get rid of those
  feelings simply by taking thought. But you can at least recognise that you
  have them, and prevent them from contaminating your mental processes. The
  emotional urges which are inescapable, and are perhaps even necessary to
  political action, should be able to exist side by side with an acceptance of
  reality.
