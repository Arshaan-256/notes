# Python Quotes

> Only ugly languages become popular. Python is the one exception.

-- Donald Knuth, walking to dinner after Alan Turing's Centenary Celebration

> If you're talking about Java in particular, Python is about the best fit you
> can get amongst all the other languages. Yet the funny thing is, from a
> language point of view, JavaScript has a lot in common with Python, but it
> is sort of a restricted subset.

-- Guido van Rossum

## The Python Paradox

by Paul Graham -- http://www.paulgraham.com/pypar.html

In a recent talk I said something that upset a lot of people: that you could
get smarter programmers to work on a Python project than you could to work on
a Java project.

I didn't mean by this that Java programmers are dumb. I meant that Python
programmers are smart. It's a lot of work to learn a new programming language.
And people don't learn Python because it will get them a job; they learn it
because they genuinely like to program and aren't satisfied with the languages
they already know.

Which makes them exactly the kind of programmers companies should want to hire.
Hence what, for lack of a better name, I'll call the Python paradox: if a
company chooses to write its software in a comparatively esoteric language,
they'll be able to hire better programmers, because they'll attract only those
who cared enough to learn it. And for programmers the paradox is even more
pronounced: the language to learn, if you want to get a good job, is a language
that people don't learn merely to get a job.

Only a few companies have been smart enough to realize this so far. But there
is a kind of selection going on here too: they're exactly the companies
programmers would most like to work for. Google, for example. When they
advertise Java programming jobs, they also want Python experience.

A friend of mine who knows nearly all the widely used languages uses Python for
most of his projects. He says the main reason is that he likes the way source
code looks. That may seem a frivolous reason to choose one language over
another. But it is not so frivolous as it sounds: when you program, you spend
more time reading code than writing it. You push blobs of source code around
the way a sculptor does blobs of clay. So a language that makes source code
ugly is maddening to an exacting programmer, as clay full of lumps would be to
a sculptor.
