When you run `help(function_written_in_Python)`, the first line of the help is
the function's signature rendered in text.  That's generated by `pydoc`, which
gets signature information from inspect.  Now, it used to be that this didn't
work for builtins.  `pydoc` would look at the function, say "I can't get
metadata for this function, I'll skip it".  And it'd just print the builtin's
docstring.  Builtins worked around this problem by having their first line
*look* like a Python signature.  So the user kind of couldn't tell the
difference.

As part of adding Argument Clinic, I changed this.  Now the first line of a
docstring is a machine-readable representation of the signature of the function.
Internally it gets split off from the docstring--you won't see it if you look at
`builtin.__doc__`.  Instead this first line is provided via a new property
called `__text_signature__`.  `inspect.Signature` supports builtins by parsing
this string.

As it happens, the format of the string happens to look exactly like a Python
function definition.  Because... it is!  `inspect.Signature` parses the string
by passing it in to `ast.parse`.

"decompressobj([wbits], [zdict])" is not legal Python; if you gave that to
`ast.parse` it would reject it.  (I tried, with PEP 457, but so far nobody has
been interested.)  On the other hand, `ast.parse` is totally happy with
"decompressobj(wbits=None, zdict=None)".
