# The Same

*Haven (2000)*

what we always fear and loathe
becomes of us
repay the visit of our loss
reset the marks again
the turning point
seems to be holding on

sands of ages and the stars above
everchanging as the same hearts beat
repeating 'til the end
seas of slander and the soil we walk
everchanging as the same hearts beat
it ends up all the same

the sail that never knew the wind
barren and lost
our wrecks these shores will never reach
a trek on darker trails
let days be done
it takes forever
