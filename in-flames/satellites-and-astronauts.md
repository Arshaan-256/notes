# Satellites and Astronauts

*Clayman (2000)*

Since the day of my departure  
I've been stumbling through reality  
I play my symphony in reverse  
As I aim for that special chance  

Be gentle to the tear in this eye  
These lonesome arms, lost it's wings again  

Buy me a trip to the moon  
So I can laugh at my mistakes  
You see, I can see the end from here  

From this perspective it looks kind of silly  
Satellites and astronauts  
Tell me there are greater things ahead  

Make me feel like a man  
A silent cry from the middle of hell  
I, the irony, I promise, I'll be mature  
So please, please invite me  
Please invite me to your shelter again  

Been hiding since I heard, "Will never"  
Take me back to yesterday, I need to grow  

Buy me a trip to the moon  
So I can laugh at my mistakes  
You see, I can see the end from here  

From this perspective it looks kind of silly  
Satellites and astronauts  
Tell me there are greater things ahead  

Buy me a trip to the moon  
So I can laugh at my mistakes  
You see, I can see the end from here  

From this perspective it looks kind of silly  
Satellites and astronauts  
Tell me there  

Steal my mask and make me pay  
I need a new skin  
I'm going insane
