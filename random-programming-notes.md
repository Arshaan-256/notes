* Declarative code is an evaluation of expressions, whereas imperative code is
  a series of statements that mutate state. [[Source][source1]]
* The reduction of dependence on state creates code that’s easier to test in an
  automated manner because less mocking is required; code that’s more stable to
  ongoing change because it has less dependence on state side effects; code
  with greater separation of concerns which aids readability and conceptual
  understanding. [[Source][source1]]
