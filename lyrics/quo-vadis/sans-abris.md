# Sans Abris

*Forever... (1996)*

Ends that justify the means  
Dogma evokes obedience  
Conscience deceived  
Deaf to suffering  
Silencing morality and screams  
As you look away  
Reality is what you want to feel  
And what you want to see  

Rationalize  
To overcome the guilt  
Your self righteous certainty  
Shatters as you become prey.
