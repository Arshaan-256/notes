## Ten Commandments

*(Sullivan) 1986*

Down comes Moses with the Ten Commandments  
Hewn on a tablet, just the bitterest pill  
Breaks up the party in the valley below  
Says obey my orders and you're doing God's will  
And disciples of Jesus, lost and forgotten  
When the brand new faith isn't doing so well  
Write the Book of Revelation to terrify the people  
Join our religion or you're heading for hell

Ch: I will bow to the earth, bow to the sea,  
Bow to the love between you and me,  
Bow to the sun, bow to the land  
But never to a god made in the image of man  
Here comes Mohammed, back from the desert  
Another male prophet with the word of the Lord  
Shut off the women, lock them in darkness  
Kill all opponents in a holy war  
Here is murder, here is oppression  
Here is the order that the Church demands  
Burn three million women, call them witches and heretics

Then change the tune when the fashion demands  
How they run to you now, how they grovel to you now  
I think they're mad  
How they subjugate their pride as if it's a sin to be alive  
I think that's sad  
Down with Moses and his Ten Commandments  
Deader than deadest of the Dead Sea Scrolls  
Back to the desert with Jesus and Mohammed  
Kick out the prophets and save our souls
