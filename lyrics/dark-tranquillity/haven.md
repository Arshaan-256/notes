# Haven

*Haven (2000)*

now as the lights go down  
deeper now it seems than long before  
there are no noises here  
just a silence gone bad  
something I will never hide  
this urging need to  

invite the darkside in  
into my haven  

if there were words for this  
would I sing or should I scream?  
I'd give my blood to stay  
my blood just to stay right here  
something can never share  
this urging need to  

invite the darkside in  
into my haven
