# On Your Time

*Projector (1999)*

neither here nor there in our unity of twine  
solitary sanity, traded in for life  

once we crawled into the artificial night  
all was left and I arrived on your time  

there in the collision  
wish answers could arrive  
was I kept up for this?  
did the physical emotion  
break the fall of sleep?  

I'd never thought of things that you would say  
could never tell if what you said were lies  

it's in here eating  
it's down there drinking  
be with me, not against me  
bear with it, love against me  

I've never known if there was enough time  
could never tell if it was done just right  

an icicle thrust  
to soothe the disorder  
between the eyes  
where the well is the deepest  

and so unease carried words  
that spoke of no matter  
was I held here for this?  
did the path of devotion stay from what you felt?  

I've never seen things here in this light  
could never tell it your touch was deeper than skin  

once I thought that what no time can heal  
is here in me - but time proved me wrong  
deeper still toward an outward pride  
no more lies - I'm here on your time
