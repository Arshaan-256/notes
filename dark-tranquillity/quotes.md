Mikael: A construct is something that exists in your own mind. A kind of
fantasy. I’m intrigued by the human need to make stuff up. That we create
something to believe in to feel more at ease. I’m primarily thinking of
religion, of course. In the context of the album, a construct is a negative
thing. Half of the songs deal with every-day things while the other half
have a more philosophical angle. I’m trying to work out why things end up a
certain way. The bottom line is that you can’t trust the human brain, that
everything’s subjective and that you’re always wrong. You don’t know
everything. You can’t even trust your own memory.
