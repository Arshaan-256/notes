## [Atheism](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/julian-baggini-on-atheism/)

*Julian Baggini*

* Atheism, on the face of it, seems straightforward: it’s not theism. It’s
  a belief that there is no God or gods. But it’s slightly more complicated
  than that because, for most self-identifying atheists, it’s not just that
  they don’t believe in a God or gods, but that they don’t believe in any kind
  of supernatural realm. So I think an atheist is, 95% of the time,
  a naturalist. Atheists believe that whatever may be in the universe, the only
  kind of stuff is the stuff of physics, and the only fundamental forces are
  those of physics.

* I think an agnostic is someone who is really just unsure, someone who can’t
  make up his or her mind whether they believe God exists or not. An atheist is
  someone who has a pretty settled view that there is no God, but within that,
  there’s a spectrum of people who are absolutely convinced, and those who
  simply think that the balance of evidence is strong enough that they don’t
  want to sit on the fence, but beyond that, they’re not going to claim any
  absolute certainty.

* As a child, I was religious by default, and then religious by conviction, and
  then I came to atheism. But after a while, when you’ve thought through the
  issues, and you’ve decided that’s where you stand, you don’t close your mind.
  You want to go on and think about other things.

* Atheism is not something that defines your every moment of existence. I don’t
  wake up in the morning reminding myself that I don’t believe in God.

* The Platonic dialogues can be stylistically grating because it seems that
  anyone who is forced into conversation with Socrates is just there to be
  shown how wrong they are. Most of the time, people are just saying ‘Yes,
  Socrates, I agree, Socrates,’ or they’re falling straight into his traps. In
  Hume’s Dialogues, you get very strong versions of the arguments on both
  sides. If you were to read the Dialogues—without knowing in advance which
  side Hume was on—there are certainly places where you wouldn’t be sure
  whether or not this book was ultimately going to be a defence of religion.

* Serious Sartreans get quite annoyed with this book because it’s a very
  accessible, easy-to-read, non-technical, public lecture. Many Sartreans think
  that unless you’ve read Being and Nothingness from cover to cover and pored
  over the footnotes, you don’t really understand Sartre. For them, people like
  me who say, ‘I like Sartre, I like Existentialism and Humanism’ are a bit
  like people who say ‘I really like Wagner, that ‘Ride of the Valkyries’ is
  a great tune,’ but have never sat through the Ring Cycle.

* It is important to bear in mind that there are difficulties, there are
  problems, and for all that I agree that meaning and value are possible
  without God, the thought that this is all there is—and everything that
  matters to us is going to be extinguished, and in a moment I could die, and
  nothing would be left behind, and everything I worked for would just
  disappear, from my point of view—is a disturbing thought.

* When refugees wash up dead on the shores of Europe, you can’t have that
  reassurance in the back of your mind that they’ve now entered the bosom of
  their creator, and everything is going to be all right. Far from it: theirs
  were lives that were hard, and difficult, and were ended prematurely. All we
  can do is try and stop other people having to live and die in that way in the
  future. A greater appreciation of life is one result of atheism. Although
  that sounds very positive, it does make life bittersweet, because you know
  everything is passing, and nothing’s ever permanent. There’s an awareness of
  the coming dusk, always there, while we appreciate the sunshine.


## [Evolution of the Earth](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/evolution-earth-andrew-scott/)

*Andrew Scott*

* When cyanobacteria first evolved they lived in areas of the ocean that
  received sunlight. This was a relatively limited area and as a result the
  amount of oxygen was initially small and it all dissolved in ocean water. It
  was not until the oceans were fully oxygenated — a process that took the best
  part of two billion years — that it was able to build up in the atmosphere
  too. This accumulation  led to a remarkable new stage in the evolution of the
  Earth. Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun turned oxygen high in the
  atmosphere into ozone, and the ozone began to act as a ‘shield’ in the sense
  that it blocked much of that radiation, which is harmful to life, from
  reaching the Earth’s surface. This made it possible for life to come out of
  the water onto land. In addition carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere were
  falling as were global temperatures, all of which made the spread of life on
  to land more possible. It was not until around 630 million years ago that we
  find significant numbers of larger multicellular plants and animals in the
  oceans so in that sense the time lag to land colonisation is not so great.

  Land surfaces were transformed with the move of plant life from the aquatic
  to the terrestrial realm. Plants moved on to the land certainly by the late
  Silurian period, 420 million years ago. These plants were small and limited
  to where they could grow so the build up of sufficient fuel to burn would not
  be easy. Yet it is at that time we find the first evidence of fire with the
  occurrence of charcoal. And this tells us other things. We know from
  experiments that for plants to burn and a fire to be sustained we need around
  17% oxygen in the atmosphere. So by the late Silurian we have the fuel and
  oxygen. Lightning would have been the primary means by which fires start.

  Plants on land helped in breaking down rocks to provide a soil as well as
  drawing down carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and giving off oxygen. Some
  of carbon of the plant material will have been locked up in charcoal and not
  recycled further reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and
  this helped temperatures on land to fall making it more hospitable.

* For the first 50 million years or so atmospheric oxygen varied so that it was
  often below 17%. However, at the beginning of the Carboniferous period,
  around 360 million years ago, it rose to around the modern level, which is
  21%, and then above it. By this time also trees had evolved and some plants
  developed seeds that allowed plants to spread into drier environments. Fire
  systems then became well established, therefore, through the Carboniferous
  and Permian 360-250 million years ago. A number of plants such as ferns were
  able to take advantage of regular fires as they could easily spread into
  burnt and disturbed environments. Other plants such as the newly evolved
  conifers developed strategies of dropping their branches so that surface
  fires did not spread up the trunks to create more devastating crown fires.

  We know that there were major changes on Earth around 250 million years ago
  at the end of the Permian, when life nearly died on Earth. But perhaps the
  most important phase of our story was in the Cretaceous, between 140 and 65
  million years ago. At this time atmospheric oxygen levels were high and fires
  were large and regular. This affected herbivorous dinosaurs as for many their
  food source was destroyed. We might also speculate that flight in feathered
  dinosaurs might have been encouraged, as they had to flee such rapidly
  spreading fires. However, ferns were able to take advantage of the regularly
  burned areas, and then flowering plants that were initially fast growing
  weeds were able to spread more widely. We also know that many groups of
  plants evolved traits to cope with or use fire, such as the evolution of
  thick bark in Pines or regrowth strategies in Eucalypts or reproductive
  strategies in Proteas. By the end of the Cretaceous fire was playing a major
  role in stabilising atmospheric oxygen levels in the atmosphere.

  Around seven million years ago, when savanna grasslands spread across a dry
  Africa, plants began to take advantage of fire in an interesting new way. The
  grasses were able survive frequently relatively cool surface fires but these
  had the effect of killing shrubs and trees if the fires were frequent enough.
  Fire then maintains this ecosystem and the animals its supports.

* Fires can kill animals as they pass though, but the flush of new vegetation
  following many fires would have a large number of animals that could be
  hunted. Walking humans would have been able to spot a fire from a long
  distance from the smoke plumes. We often think of the control of fire is
  a particular human trait so it would make sense that it took place in such
  a system. Humans would have first collected burning embers and deliberately
  kept the flame alight, perhaps using dung to conserve fire. This may have
  happened as far back as 1.5 million years ago or even earlier. However it was
  the ability to start a fire that was to prove so important. We have evidence
  for this ability from 40,000 years ago but it was probably long before that.

* Even today there is debate as to where life originated – many now believing
  that it was in the bottom of the ocean near black smokers where the bacteria
  could get energy from the centre of the Earth rather than from the sun.
  However a key change took place at around 2700 million years ago. This is the
  evolution of oxygen-generating cyanobacteria I referred to earlier. At first
  this oxygenation changed the chemistry of the oceans but later as oxygen
  leaked out into the atmosphere then an ozone layer could form, there was
  protection from the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun and life could
  then venture onto land.

* I had been helped in some of my early excavations by a local man named Stan
  Wood. Stan had first found extraordinary fossils of early animals in a dry
  stone wall surrounding a football pitch during a half time break of a match
  at which he was the referee! This led him to explore a nearby quarry and to
  involve what is now the National Scottish Museum. I love this story as it
  shows how anyone, professional or amateur, with a passion for fossils can
  find amazing things at any time of life. The excavation of the site became an
  international multidisciplinary affair and I was tasked at coordinating
  studies of the fossil plants and even named one Stanwoodia, after Stan.

* Humans are, arguably, the only species that not only adapts to new
  environments but also adapts their environment to themselves.


## [Belgium](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/belgium-history-martin-conway/)

*Martin Conway*

* One of the big features of Belgian history in the last couple of years has
  been a large public history project that goes under the rather jokey title of
  ‘Was Grandpa a Nazi?’ This is really an attempt by the Belgian authorities to
  open up the archives and make it possible for people to discover their own
  family history. The authorities are quite rightly aware that a lot of
  grandchildren are keen to understand the choices their grandparents may have
  made during the war—not necessarily about having been a fascist, but perhaps
  about being a resistor, or a deported person. There are all different
  versions of war experience.

* > I just know her [Marguerite Yourcenar] as the first woman elected to the
  > Académie française, so I presumed she was French.

  Yes. The French are quite good at claiming Belgians as their own. One could
  produce a whole series of 20th-century writers who were in fact Belgian and
  not French.


## [The French Revolution](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/french-revolution-lynn-hunt/)

* [...] you are more likely to end up as a democracy if you have institutions
  that support a democratic political life. It’s a tragedy and a paradox. You
  make a revolution because you don’t have the institutions that support
  a democratic political life. You do it in order to get a democratic political
  life, but you don’t have the infrastructure in place to make that possible.

* [...] countries develop a style of governing and that it’s extremely
  difficult to get away from that style of governing. For example, in
  interpretations of the Russian Revolution there’s a complete division between
  those who feel that communism took over the basic characteristics of Tsarist
  rule – which was incredibly centralised and authoritarian, and relied on the
  secret service – and those who believe that Marxism completely changed
  everything. This kind of division of opinion exists for all the major
  revolutions, in part because of the influence of this Tocquevillean analysis,
  which is that you have a style of ruling, and it’s very hard to change it.

* [...] nothing is more dangerous to a regime than when it tries to reform
  itself.

* Democracy can lead not just to despotism, but to totalitarianism. For him
  [François Furet], what’s wrong with the revolution is that it’s all ideology
  and fighting over who is going to represent the general will of Rousseau and
  who is supposedly going to represent the people in democratic terms. Because
  it’s all ideology it doesn’t actually set up democratic forms of government,
  it veers off into terror and totalitarianism instead.

* They [Committee of Public Safety] were not completely out of control. For the
  most part, the people on this committee are living incredibly austere lives.
  They’re working 20 hours a day, they’re devoting themselves completely to the
  cause of trying to save the republic. And, the fact is, they succeed. They
  are able to reorganise the military under the worst of all possible
  circumstances. They actually win the war, in a situation in which winning the
  war seemed totally impossible.

* Maybe I’m obsessive about this, but the whole question, “Does the revolution
  fail?” or “Why does the revolution fail?” is a misguided one. What he shows
  you is that all these different things change in ways that will never be
  turned back again. They’re institutional changes, so the things that
  Tocqueville says don’t happen, the things that Furet says don’t happen and
  lead the revolution to veer off into totalitarianism, he’s [Isser Woloch]
  showing they are changed by the revolution, and remain an important part of
  French life right up to the present.

* One of the things that goes on in the revolution is that things are laid out
  on the agenda which will remain on the agenda for generations to come.
  Divorce is instituted in 1792. They don’t get back to the same divorce law
  until the 1970s. Universal education is laid out as a programme, they start
  trying to do it, but it’s not really achieved until the end of the 19th
  century. But certain things are achieved. The rewriting of the penal code,
  from 1791, is essentially the penal code that will remain in existence ever
  after. They eliminate torture in the judicial process for ever. They
  institute equality under the law for ever. They institute forms of legal
  inheritance for children, including girls, that will remain in the law for
  ever. These are incredibly fundamental changes that take place. Amongst them,
  and one that people tend to forget, is that when the monarchy comes back in
  1814, there is a constitution. There is a written document that says, there’s
  going to be a lower house and an upper house. Yes, they limit the vote, but
  there is no way that you’re not going to have a constitutional form of
  government from that time onwards. These are crucial developments in French
  political and social life that shape what happens during the entire 19th and
  20th centuries.


## [David Hume](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/david-hume-simon-blackburn/)

* The 17th and 18th centuries were preoccupied with the idea that if we had
  a proper understanding of human nature, we’d have a proper account of human
  understanding and of its limits.

* [...] Hume did think that overconfidence and dogmatism led to intolerance, to
  faction, to a lot of the crimes of human history. So if you could show, in
  a decisive way, where our limits lie, we could improve on that abysmal
  history.

* > Be a philosopher; but, amidst all your philosophy, be still a man.

  (*An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding*, chapter "Of the Different
  Species of Philosophy")


## [Predators](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/pyenson-predators/)

* By the time humans evolved, whales had been the brainiest mammals (as
  measured from brain size to body size) on the planet for at least five
  million years, if not ten.

* For killer whales the challenges vary. In the North Pacific, for instance,
  one kind, or ‘ecotype’ are exclusively fish-eating residents along the coast
  of North America. They suffer because we have cut off their favoured  prey
  source—the salmon runs.

* Humpback whales were delisted from the US endangered species list in 1994,
  and grey whales seem to be making incursions into the Atlantic, an ocean they
  haven’t been in for over 400 years. In both of those cases, the cessation of
  whaling has contributed to their success, but their broad diet and geographic
  range, along with some aspects of their life history, have also been
  important factors.

* [...] we now know close to three million whales were killed during the
  twentieth century.

* [...] because we share a common ancestor with baboons; a lot of similarities
  that we see in their behaviour, from grooming, to dominance displays, to
  foraging habits, have to do with our shared evolutionary history.


## [The Incompatibility of Religion and Science](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/jerry-coyne-incompatibility-religion-science/)

* My argument is not that religious people are constantly battling science or
  trying to prevent it moving forward, but that the methods that religion uses
  to ascertain truths about the universe are at odds with the methods that
  science uses. They’re in competition with each other. [...] Religion doesn’t
  have a reliable way to discern truth and this is the real conflict. It’s
  a conflict of methodology, it’s a conflict of philosophy, and, ultimately,
  it’s a conflict of outcomes.

* I don’t care if a religious person accepts science and practises their own
  private faith. The problem is that this acceptance of faith — which means
  belief without substantial evidence — as a useful means to ascertain truth
  has invidious social consequences. In my country, it’s opposition to
  abortion, it’s opposition to gay marriage. Creationism is the least of our
  worries. It’s this enabling of faith, this untoward respect for belief
  without evidence, that has caused so much mischief. If religious people just
  kept to themselves, just went to church, respected the findings of science
  and a) didn’t teach it to their kids (which I think is a form of child
  mistreatment) and b) didn’t try to take their religious beliefs into the
  public sphere and make them law for everybody else, then I wouldn’t care so
  much. But that’s not the way it is. Certainly not in Muslim countries, where
  religion and government are almost synonymous. It is a widespread problem.

* The problem with the Soviet Union and China is that religion was replaced by
  an ideology which was largely anti-science and certainly anti-rational. In
  Russia, under Stalin, the cult of the leader replaced religious belief.
  That’s why they didn’t like religion, because it displaced people’s
  affections for the leader. It was in the Soviet Union that Lysenkoism, which
  is explicitly anti-scientific, took over and ruined Russian genetics for 30
  years.

* I have faith — and I use the term in the sense of ‘confidence in’ — that
  ultimately people will realize that the Enlightenment project, the project of
  using rationality to guide your actions, is the way to bring society forward.
  My book is about religions versus science, but that’s really a battle in the
  greater war between superstition and rationality.

* [...] there’s something about religion that brings out the worst in people.
  I think it’s partly the moral code — which is inherent in almost all the
  Abrahamic religions — which science doesn’t have. In science, you say,
  ‘Here’s what we found’ — but there’s no stricture, no ‘OK this is what you’ve
  got to do with it.’ That’s where people come in — and you get bad people
  using science to make atomic bombs etc. That’s not part of science itself,
  that’s just human personality. It’s partly that religion has belief in
  absolute truth, which science also doesn’t. Finally, in many religions, there
  is a system of eternal punishments and rewards. If you combine those three
  toxic aspects you get people doing stuff they wouldn’t be doing if there
  wasn’t religion. If there wasn’t Catholicism, would we have the demonization
  of gays in the US? Would we have all this opposition to abortion? Look at
  Ireland — where abortion is illegal and women die because the fetus gets
  stuck and blasphemy is still against the law. Imagine Ireland without
  religion. Would those things still exist? I don’t think so. And you can say
  — which I suppose is what you are saying — that something else would rush in
  to fill the gap and we’d still hate gay people and restrict abortions. But
  I’m not so sure about that. Certainly that hasn’t happened in northern
  Europe.

* [...] he [Carl Sagan] maintains that pseudosciences — and he includes
  religion in that — have to be judged as sciences, because they make empirical
  claims about reality. That’s a claim that most religious people instinctively
  reject. Shelley was the first person to say that God is a hypothesis,
  therefore believers should be forced to give evidence for it.

* > He [Carl Sagan] does seem to think it’s more likely there are aliens than
  > that there’s a God.

  A lot of people do. Because aliens are naturalistic phenomena whereas gods
  are supernatural and we don’t have evidence for anything supernatural. Sagan
  was involved in the SETI project to detect alien life. He was unsuccessful,
  but if I had to put my money on either, ‘Is there life somewhere else in the
  universe?’ or ‘Is there a supernatural being?’ I’d definitely bet on the
  former. It is likely that there are other forms of life somewhere.

* [On whether we have free will] I can explain it to you in one second why we
  don’t, and it’s this: our brains are made of molecules. Molecules obey the
  laws of physics therefore everything that comes out of our brain, including
  our behaviors and choices, must obey the laws of physics. Therefore, in so
  far as those laws apply, everything we do is basically determined. It may be
  determined on a macro-level or fundamentally indeterminate on a quantum level
  but we cannot affect how our brains work by thinking about it, because even
  our thinking is physically-based. So that means we can’t make a choice. If
  you were to go back to last night, when you were drinking wine, you didn’t
  have a choice how many glasses you had. It could have been predicted in
  advance by the circumstances of nature. People hate that, they really hate
  it. That’s one reason Alex’s book has received a lot of scorn and dislike,
  because it basically speaks the truth. We are physical automatons.

* People like to think they can make choices. They like to think that
  consciousness is something other than an illusion that comes from molecular
  interactions.

* The Catholic theologian John Haught said that we can live with science, we
  can respect the findings of science, but that what religious people can’t
  abide is “the conviction that the universe and life is pointless.” And yet
  Steven Weinberg, who is an atheist and Nobel Prize winning physicist, has
  said that the more the universe seems comprehensible, the more it seems
  pointless. So there’s a real clash there between science and religion that
  cannot be overcome, even if you’re a science-friendly believer.

* Theology is basically a warped form of philosophy. [...] Theology is the kind
  of philosophy that’s applied to a non-existent object. So they use all the
  tools of philosophy. If you read sophisticated theology there’s even Bayesian
  analysis and mathematical logic in there. So it looks like philosophy but it
  all applies to a meaningless question involving a non-existent being.

* To me, even a great novel is a much more worthwhile accomplishment than
  anything theological, because theology pretends it’s about reality whereas in
  novels you suspend disbelief from the very beginning. You get immersed in
  a world which you know is fictional but from which you can still get
  emotional satisfaction. With religion you’re immersed in a world which is
  supposed to be real.

* Religion also appeals to the communality of people, their desire to get
  together. It gives them a sense of security, of community — that may account
  for it, certainly some people say it does.

* The refusal of western leaders to recognize that religion is behind a lot of
  this stuff [he is talking about Muslims who want to impose theocracies on
  western democracies] — saying it’s due to political oppression, or
  disenfranchisement or it’s our fault ultimately — is a real block in trying
  to do anything about the problem, because we refuse to admit one of the
  obvious causes which is religious belief.

* The problem is if you go into Saudi Arabia and ask people what they believe,
  they’ll kill you. Look at the Pew study which studied the attitudes of
  Muslims around the world by asking them questions. Do you think Sharia law
  should be imposed? Do you favour stoning for adulterers? Do you favour the
  death penalty for apostates? The results, by the way, were very depressing
  because even in western countries a substantial fraction of Muslims favoured
  these oppressive practices. But the countries that weren’t surveyed were
  countries like Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, because they weren’t even
  allowed to go in there and ask those questions. Even asking people what they
  believe is regarded as a form of dissing religion.
