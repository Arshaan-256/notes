# Just Babies

*Paul Bloom* (2013)

## Notes

* > Everyone without exception believes his own native customs, and the

  From *Histories* by Herodotus

* It turns out, then, that here is no hard-and-fast difference, as far as the
  genes are concerned, between an individual and its blood relatives.

* Now, it's true that the world as a whole would be worse off if the demonic
  genes proliferated, but this is the problem, not the solution-natural
  selection is insensitive to considerations about "the world as a whole."

* When my sons were babies, I would stare at them and wonder what, precisely,
  stared back. They were like my dog, only more fascinating.

* The developmental psychologist John Flavell once said that the would give up
  all his degress and honors for just five minutes inside the head of
  a two-year-old.

* Babies are even harder to study than rats and pigeons, which can at least run
  mazes or peck at levers.

* When my colleague and collaborator Karen Wynn is giving a public talk about
  conducting research with baby subjects, she puts up a picture of a slug for
  comparison.

* A vast body of research now suggests that babies think of objects largely as
  adults do, as connected masses that move as units, that are solid and subject
  to gravity, and that move in continuous paths through space and time.

* [...] babies can do rudimentary math with objects.

* Here's how to freak out a baby: sit across from the baby, engage with him or
  her, and then suddenly become still. If this goes on for more than a few
  seconds, with you looking all corpselike, the baby will become upset. In one
  study, two-month-olds were seated across from a TV screen displaying their
  mother. When the mother interacted with the babies by means of real-time
  videoconferencing, babies enjoyed it. But when there was a time delay of
  a few seconds, the babies became agitated.

* Babies watched as an adult looked at an object in one box, then observed the
  object move to another box while the adult's eyes were covered. Later on,
  they expected the adult to react into the original box, not the box that
  actually contained the object. This is a sophisticated psychological
  inference, the sort of rich understanding of other minds that most
  psychologists used to believe only four- and five-year-olds were cabaple of.

* Just as critics describe much of experimental psychology as the study of the
  American college undergraduate who wants beer money, there's some truth to
  the claim that a lot of developmental psychology is the study of the
  interested and alert baby.

* People could not be moral without the capacity to tell right from wrong.

* But it's clear as well that conscience emerges at an early age to help us
  resist those urges. Indeed, in many instances, we don't need the threat of
  punishment to be good, because acting selfishly or cruelly can be inherently
  unpleasant. One example of this comes from a study in the 1930s that asked
  questions such as "How much money would it take for you to strangle a cat
  with your bare hands?" The average answer was $10,000--about $155,000 in
  today's dollars. The same individuals required only half as much money to
  agree to have one of their front teeth pulled out.

* [...] some contemporary researchers use the terms interchangeably, but there
  is a big difference between caring about a person (compassion) and putting
  yourself in the person's shoes (empathy).

* [...] empathy is not needed to motivate compassion.

* Philosophers seem to be fond of examples with drowning children: about two
  thousand years ago, the Chinese scholar Mencius wrote, "No man is devoid of
  a heart sensitive to the suffering of others... Suppose a man were, all of
  a sudden, to see a young child on the verge of failing into a well. He would
  certainly be moved to compassion.")

* [...] just as you can have compassion without empathy, you can have empathy
  without compassion.

* [...] being asked to adopt someone else's perspective makes participants more
  likely to favor that person over others. For example, they are more prone to
  move a suffering girl ahead of everyone else on a waiting list for
  a livesaving procedure. This is compassionate, but it's not moral, since this
  sort of decision should be based on objective and fair procedures, not on who
  inspires the most intense emotional reaction. Part of being a good person,
  then, involves overriding one's compassion, not cultivating it.

* While compassion isn't the same as morality and sometimes clashes with it,
  still, it's necessary. There would be no morality if we didn't care for
  others.

* Even a few days after birth, the sound of crying is unpleasant for babies; it
  tends to make them cry themselves. This isn't a dumb response to noise.
  Babies cry more at the sound of another baby's cry than their own, and they
  don't cry as much when they hear a computergenerated noise at the same value,
  or when they hear the cries of a chimpanzee infant. Other creatures also find
  it unpleasant when members of their species are in distress.

* Hungry rhesus monkeys avoid pulling a lever to get food if doing so will give
  another monkey a painful electric shock. Rats will press a bar to lower
  another rat that is suspended midair or to release a rat that is trapped in
  a tank full of water; and, like monkeys, they will stop pressing a bar that
  provides food if that action shocks another rat.

* [...] when we look at how babies and young children act, we see something
  more. They don't just turn away from the person in pain. They try to make the
  other person feel better.

* [...] when young children see the people around them acting as if they are in
  pain, [...] they often respond by soothing. Girls are more likely to soothe
  than boys, which meshes with a broader body of research suggesting greater
  empathy and compassion, on average, in females. And you can see similar
  behavior in other primates; according to the primatologist Frans de Wall,
  a chimpanzee--but not a monkey--will put its arm around the victim of an
  attack and pat her or groom her.

* In one study where rats had the chance to press a bar to stop another rat
  from experiencing painful electric shocks, many of the rats didn't press the
  bar but instead "retreated to the corner of their box farthest from the
  distressed, squeaking, and dancing animal and crouched there, motionless."

* [...] psychologists have found that toddlers help adults who are struggling
  to pick up an object that is out of reach or to open a door while their arms
  are full. The toddlers do so without any prompting from the adults, not even
  eye contact. This behavior is impressive, because helping--like
  soothing--poses certain challenges. The toddler has to figure out that
  something is wrong, know what to do to make it better, and be motivated to
  actually go to the effort of helping.

* [...] conducted an experiment in which an adult played with a three-year-old
  and asked him or her to hand over certain objects for certain tasks. For
  example, the adult had a pitcher of water next to her and asked the child,
  "Can you hand me the cup so that I can pour the water?" When the object
  requested was suitable--an unbroken cup, for example--children usually handed
  it over. But sometimes the object requested was unsuited for the task, such
  as a cup with a crack in it. Martin and Olson found that children often
  ignored the requested item and reached for a suitable one, such as an intact
  cup in another part of the room. So the children weren't just dumbly
  complying with the adult; they wanted to actually help her complete the task.

* [...] found that three-year-olds were more likely to help someone who had
  previously helped someone else and less likely to help someone who had been
  cruel to another person.

* Malthusianism - It's the idea that population growth is potentially
  exponential while the growth of the food supply is linear. It derives from
  the political and economic thought of the Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus, as
  laid out in his 1798 writings, An Essay on the Principle of Population,
  Malthus believed there were two types of "checks" that in all times and
  places kept population growth in line with the growth of the food supply:
  "preventive checks", such as moral restraints (abstinence, delayed marriage
  until finances become balanced), and restricting marriage against persons
  suffering poverty or perceived as defective, and "positive checks", which
  lead to premature death: disease, starvation, war, resulting in what is
  called a Malthusian catastrophe. The catastrophe would return population to
  a lower, more "sustainable", level.

* categorical imperative - Introduced in Kant's 1785 Groundwork of the

  for action.

  According to Kant, human beings occupy a special place in creation, and
  morality can be summed up in an imperative, or ultimate commandment of
  reason, from which all duties and obligations derive. He defined an
  imperative as any proposition declaring a certain action (or inaction) to be
  necessary.
* veil of ignorance - The "veil of ignorance" is a method of determining the
  morality of political issues proposed in 1971 by American philosopher John
  Rawls in his "original position" political philosophy. It is based upon the
  following thought experiment: people making political decisions imagine that
  they know nothing about the particular talents, abilities, tastes, social
  class, and positions they will have within a social order. When such parties
  are selecting the principles for distribution of rights, positions, and
  resources in the society in which they will live, this "veil of ignorance"
  prevents them from knowing who will receive a given distribution of rights,
  positions, and resources in that society. For example, for a proposed society
  in which 50% of the population is kept in slavery, it follows that on
  entering the new society there is a 50% likelihood that the participant would
  be a slave. The idea is that parties subject to the veil of ignorance will
  make choices based upon moral considerations, since they will not be able to
  make choices based on their own self- or class-interest.
* impartial spectator - The impartial spectator is a type of high-level
  consciousness that transcends the ego (self-love).
