# Foucalult's Pendulum

*Umberto Eco*

## 7

I liked Marx, I was sure that he and his Jenny had made love merrily. You can
feel it in the easy pace of his prose and in his humor. On the other hand,
I remember remarking one day in the corridors of the university that if you
screwed Krupskaya all the time, you'd end up writing a lousy book like
*Materialism and Empiriocriticism*.
