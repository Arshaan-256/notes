# Notes

* Perhaps the most valuable result of all education is the ability to make
  yourself do the thing you have to do, when it ought to be done, whether you
  like it or not. -- Thomas Henry Huxley
  (*Beyond Stuttering* by Dave McGuire)

* All the joys of life in the past had a shadow cast over them. I found it
  difficult to really enjoy life, despite the fact that I tried very hard to
  be happy by intent and accept myself as a person who stutters. It was like
  an ever-present black cloud hanging over me that just wouldn't go away. My
  hidden underlying view of life was "One day I'll be dead and I won't have to
  suffer this torment anymore."
  (*Beyond Stuttering* by Dave McGuire)

* Adaletin uygulanması gibi önemli olan bir görev dîvân-ı harblere havâle
  edildi. Bir fazilet ve irfan sahibinin dediği gibi âkilin [akıllı kimsenin]
  başı askerin eline delâlet etmelidir zirâ tüfenk ve kılıca alışmış olan
  askerin eli adâlet terazisine uyuşamamıştır.
  (*Kilikya Katliamı 1909* by Sait Çetinoğlu)
