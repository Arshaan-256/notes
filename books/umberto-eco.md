* We kids hurried to pick up the shells, precious items, but I had also learned
  that freedom of speech means freedom from rhetoric.

* In May we heard that the war was over. Peace gave me a curious sensation.
  I had been told that permanent warfare was the normal condition for a young
  Italian.

* In my country today there are those who are saying that the myth of the
  Resistance was a Communist lie. It is true that the Communists exploited the
  Resistance as if it were their personal property, since they played a prime
  role in it; but I remember partisans with kerchiefs of different colors.
