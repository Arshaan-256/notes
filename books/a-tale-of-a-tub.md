# A Tale of a Tub

*Jonathan Swift* (1704)

* "I cannot but conclude the Bulk of your Natives, to be the most pernicious
  race of little odious Vermin that Nature ever suffered to crawl upon the
  Surface of the Earth."

* For upon the covers of these papers I casually observed written in large
  letters the two following words, DETUR DIGNISSIMO [1], which, for aught I
  knew, might contain some important meaning. But it unluckily fell out that
  none of the Authors I employ understood Latin (though I have them often in
  pay to translate out of that language).

[1] Detur dignissimo, Lat. -- "Let it be given to the most worthy."
