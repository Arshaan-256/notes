# A Tale of a Tub

*Jonathan Swift* (1704)

* "I cannot but conclude the Bulk of your Natives, to be the most pernicious
  race of little odious Vermin that Nature ever suffered to crawl upon the
  Surface of the Earth."

* For upon the covers of these papers I casually observed written in large
  letters the two following words, DETUR DIGNISSIMO [1], which, for aught I
  knew, might contain some important meaning. But it unluckily fell out that
  none of the Authors I employ understood Latin (though I have them often in
  pay to translate out of that language).

* Methinks the number of appellants were enough to shock and startle any
  judge of a genius less unlimited than yours; but in order to prevent such
  glorious trials, the person, it seems, to whose care the education of your
  Highness is committed, has resolved, as I am told, to keep you in almost
  an universal ignorance of our studies, which it is your inherent birthright
  to inspect.
