* To look at matters another way, just 2,871,000 words of Greek are
  preserved for all authors known to have lived at least in part in the
  fourth century or earlier. Adding the third and second centuries brings
  the total to 3,773,000 words (or about 12,600 pages of 300 words
  each). At an average of 15,000 words per roll, this corpus would
  require a mere 251 rolls. Even at an average of 10,000 words per roll,
  the figure would be only 377 rolls. It was estimated by one eminent
  ancient historian that the original bulk of historical writings in ancient
  Greece amounted to something like forty times what has survived. If
  so, our estimate would run to an original body of 10,000 to 15,000
  rolls.
* In sum, the ancient figures for the size of the Library or the number
  of volumes lost in the Alexandrine War do not deserve any credence.
* They do not appear to rest on any good ancient authority, they were
  repeated from author to author, and when their consequences are
  examined, they lead to impossibilities and absurdities. The actual
  numbers were probably lower, perhaps by as much as one order of
  magnitude.
* One has only to imagine the difficulties involved in cataloging such a
  collection. Book-form catalogs, even with all the advantages of the large
  codex, ceased to be useful when modern libraries started to reach the
  kinds of middle six-figure sizes imagined for Alexandria, and had to be
  replaced by the card catalog, unknown in antiquity. My own university's
  library grew from 20,000 volumes in 1856 to 100,000 in 1889 and 362,000
  in 1903. Even the giants did not reach the middle six digits until the
  middle of the nineteenth century, precisely the point at which the card
  catalog started to come into use. The British Museum had only some 200,000
  volumes in 1830, reaching a million a third of a century later.
* Callimachus's famous Pinakes, a systematic listing of genres, authors, and
  works in 120 books, could not have held the information necessary to
  catalog hundreds of thousands of rolls.
* Even without hostile action, then, the Library, or Libraries, of
  Alexandria would not have survived antiquity. Indeed, any library
  almost certainly would have been a sorry remnant well before late
  antiquity, unless its books were constantly replaced by new copies,
  with the rolls being supplanted by codices in the fourth century. The
  ancients already were aware of this necessity: Jerome reports that the
  library at Caesarea founded by the theologian Origen was restored in
  the mid-fourth century by the copying of the books onto parchment.
  But there is no evidence that any such replacement went on in Alexandria,
  nor any indication that the imperial Roman government provided
  any book acquisition budget to the Library. That does not mean there
  was none, but it is not likely to have been on the scale needed to maintain
  a truly great library.
* It is hard to give up villains, but it looks as if we must abandon the
  search for some individual or small group to blame. The disappearance
  of the Library is the inevitable result of the end of the impetus and
  interest that brought it into being and of the lack of the kind of
  sustained management and maintenance that would have seen it through
  successive transitions in the physical media by means of which the texts
  could have been transmitted.
