* We kids hurried to pick up the shells, precious items, but I had also learned
  that freedom of speech means freedom from rhetoric.

* In May we heard that the war was over. Peace gave me a curious sensation.
  I had been told that permanent warfare was the normal condition for a young
  Italian.

* In my country today there are those who are saying that the myth of the
  Resistance was a Communist lie. It is true that the Communists exploited the
  Resistance as if it were their personal property, since they played a prime
  role in it; but I remember partisans with kerchiefs of different colors.

* Consider the following sequence:

  ```
  1 2 3 4

  abc bcd cde def
  ```

  Suppose there is a series of political groups in which group one is
  characterized by the features abc, group two by the features bcd, and so on.
  Group two is similar to group one since they have two features in common; for
  the same reasons three is similar to two and four is similar to three. Notice
  that three is also similar to one (they have in common the feature c). The
  most curious case is presented by four, obviously similar to three and two,
  but with no feature in common with one. However, owing to the uninterrupted
  series of decreasing similarities between one and four, there remains, by
  a sort of illusory transitivity, a family resemblance between four and one.

  Fascism became an all-purpose term because one can eliminate from a fascist
  regime one or more features, and it will still be recognizable as fascist.
  Take away imperialism from fascism and you still have Franco and Salazar.
  Take away colonialism and you still have the Balkan fascism of the Ustashes.
  Add to the Italian fascism a radical anti-capitalism (which never much
  fascinated Mussolini) and you have Ezra Pound. Add a cult of Celtic mythology
  and the Grail mysticism (completely alien to official fascism) and you have
  one of the most respected fascist gurus, Julius Evola.

  We must keep alert, so that the sense of these words will not be forgotten
  again. Ur-Fascism is still around us, sometimes in plainclothes. It would be
  so much easier, for us, if there appeared on the world scene somebody saying,
  “I want to reopen Auschwitz, I want the Black Shirts to parade again in the
  Italian squares.” Life is not that simple. Ur-Fascism can come back under the
  most innocent of disguises. Our duty is to uncover it and to point our finger
  at any of its new instances—every day, in every part of the world.

## Features of *Ur-Fascism*

1. The first feature of Ur-Fascism is the cult of tradition. Traditionalism is
   of course much older than fascism. Not only was it typical of
   counter-revolutionary Catholic thought after the French revolution, but it
   was born in the late Hellenistic era, as a reaction to classical Greek
   rationalism. In the Mediterranean basin, people of different religions (most
   of them indulgently accepted by the Roman Pantheon) started dreaming of
   a revelation received at the dawn of human history. This revelation,
   according to the traditionalist mystique, had remained for a long time
   concealed under the veil of forgotten languages—in Egyptian hieroglyphs, in
   the Celtic runes, in the scrolls of the little known religions of Asia.

   This new culture had to be syncretistic. Syncretism is not only, as the
   dictionary says, “the combination of different forms of belief or practice”;
   such a combination must tolerate contradictions. Each of the original
   messages contains a sliver of wisdom, and whenever they seem to say
   different or incompatible things it is only because all are alluding,
   allegorically, to the same primeval truth.

   As a consequence, there can be no advancement of learning. Truth has been
   already spelled out once and for all, and we can only keep interpreting its
   obscure message.

   One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the
   major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by
   traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements. The most influential
   theoretical source of the theories of the new Italian right, Julius Evola,
   merged the Holy Grail with The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, alchemy with
   the Holy Roman and Germanic Empire. The very fact that the Italian right, in
   order to show its open-mindedness, recently broadened its syllabus to
   include works by De Maistre, Guenon, and Gramsci, is a blatant proof of
   syncretism.

   If you browse in the shelves that, in American bookstores, are labeled as
   New Age, you can find there even Saint Augustine who, as far as I know, was
   not a fascist. But combining Saint Augustine and Stonehenge—that is
   a symptom of Ur-Fascism.

2. Traditionalism implies the rejection of modernism. Both Fascists and Nazis
   worshiped technology, while traditionalist thinkers usually reject it as
   a negation of traditional spiritual values. However, even though Nazism was
   proud of its industrial achievements, its praise of modernism was only the
   surface of an ideology based upon Blood and Earth (Blut und Boden). The
   rejection of the modern world was disguised as a rebuttal of the
   capitalistic way of life, but it mainly concerned the rejection of the
   Spirit of 1789 (and of 1776, of course). The Enlightenment, the Age of
   Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense
   Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.

3. Irrationalism also depends on the cult of action for action’s sake. Action
   being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous
   reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation. Therefore culture is suspect
   insofar as it is identified with critical attitudes. Distrust of the
   intellectual world has always been a symptom of Ur-Fascism, from Goering’s
   alleged statement (“When I hear talk of culture I reach for my gun”) to the
   frequent use of such expressions as “degenerate intellectuals,” “eggheads,”
   “effete snobs,” “universities are a nest of reds.” The official Fascist
   intellectuals were mainly engaged in attacking modern culture and the
   liberal intelligentsia for having betrayed traditional values.

4. No syncretistic faith can withstand analytical criticism. The critical
   spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In
   modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to
   improve knowledge. For Ur-Fascism, disagreement is treason.

5. Besides, disagreement is a sign of diversity. Ur-Fascism grows up and seeks
   for consensus by exploiting and exacerbating the natural fear of difference.
   The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an
   appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.

6. Ur-Fascism derives from individual or social frustration. That is why one of
   the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to
   a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or
   feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower
   social groups. In our time, when the old “proletarians” are becoming petty
   bourgeois (and the lumpen are largely excluded from the political scene),
   the fascism of tomorrow will find its audience in this new majority.

7. To people who feel deprived of a clear social identity, Ur-Fascism says that
   their only privilege is the most common one, to be born in the same country.
   This is the origin of nationalism. Besides, the only ones who can provide an
   identity to the nation are its enemies. Thus at the root of the Ur-Fascist
   psychology there is the obsession with a plot, possibly an international
   one. The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is
   the appeal to xenophobia. But the plot must also come from the inside: Jews
   are usually the best target because they have the advantage of being at the
   same time inside and outside. In the US, a prominent instance of the plot
   obsession is to be found in Pat Robertson’s The New World Order, but, as we
   have recently seen, there are many others.

8. The followers must feel humiliated by the ostentatious wealth and force of
   their enemies. When I was a boy I was taught to think of Englishmen as the
   five-meal people. They ate more frequently than the poor but sober Italians.
   Jews are rich and help each other through a secret web of mutual assistance.
   However, the followers must be convinced that they can overwhelm the
   enemies. Thus, by a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are
   at the same time too strong and too weak. Fascist governments are condemned
   to lose wars because they are constitutionally incapable of objectively
   evaluating the force of the enemy.

9. For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for
   struggle. Thus pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. It is bad because
   life is permanent warfare. This, however, brings about an Armageddon
   complex. Since enemies have to be defeated, there must be a final battle,
   after which the movement will have control of the world. But such a “final
   solution” implies a further era of peace, a Golden Age, which contradicts
   the principle of permanent war. No fascist leader has ever succeeded in
   solving this predicament.

10. Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology, insofar as it is
    fundamentally aristocratic, and aristocratic and militaristic elitism
    cruelly implies contempt for the weak. Ur-Fascism can only advocate
    a popular elitism. Every citizen belongs to the best people of the world,
    the members of the party are the best among the citizens, every citizen can
    (or ought to) become a member of the party. But there cannot be patricians
    without plebeians. In fact, the Leader, knowing that his power was not
    delegated to him democratically but was conquered by force, also knows that
    his force is based upon the weakness of the masses; they are so weak as to
    need and deserve a ruler. Since the group is hierarchically organized
    (according to a military model), every subordinate leader despises his own
    underlings, and each of them despises his inferiors. This reinforces the
    sense of mass elitism.

11. In such a perspective everybody is educated to become a hero. In every
    mythology the hero is an exceptional being, but in Ur-Fascist ideology,
    heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult
    of death. It is not by chance that a motto of the Falangists was Viva la
    Muerte (in English it should be translated as “Long Live Death!”). In
    non-fascist societies, the lay public is told that death is unpleasant but
    must be faced with dignity; believers are told that it is the painful way
    to reach a supernatural happiness. By contrast, the Ur-Fascist hero craves
    heroic death, advertised as the best reward for a heroic life. The
    Ur-Fascist hero is impatient to die. In his impatience, he more frequently
    sends other people to death.

12. Since both permanent war and heroism are difficult games to play, the
    Ur-Fascist transfers his will to power to sexual matters. This is the
    origin of machismo (which implies both disdain for women and intolerance
    and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to
    homosexuality). Since even sex is a difficult game to play, the Ur-Fascist
    hero tends to play with weapons—doing so becomes an ersatz phallic
    exercise.

13. Ur-Fascism is based upon a selective populism, a qualitative populism, one
    might say. In a democracy, the citizens have individual rights, but the
    citizens in their entirety have a political impact only from a quantitative
    point of view—one follows the decisions of the majority. For Ur-Fascism,
    however, individuals as individuals have no rights, and the People is
    conceived as a quality, a monolithic entity expressing the Common Will.
    Since no large quantity of human beings can have a common will, the Leader
    pretends to be their interpreter. Having lost their power of delegation,
    citizens do not act; they are only called on to play the role of the
    People. Thus the People is only a theatrical fiction. To have a good
    instance of qualitative populism we no longer need the Piazza Venezia in
    Rome or the Nuremberg Stadium. There is in our future a TV or Internet
    populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens
    can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.

    Because of its qualitative populism Ur-Fascism must be against “rotten”
    parliamentary governments. One of the first sentences uttered by Mussolini
    in the Italian parliament was “I could have transformed this deaf and
    gloomy place into a bivouac for my maniples”—“maniples” being a subdivision
    of the traditional Roman legion. As a matter of fact, he immediately found
    better housing for his maniples, but a little later he liquidated the
    parliament. Wherever a politician casts doubt on the legitimacy of
    a parliament because it no longer represents the Voice of the People, we
    can smell Ur-Fascism.

14. Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. Newspeak was invented by Orwell, in 1984, as
    the official language of Ingsoc, English Socialism. But elements of
    Ur-Fascism are common to different forms of dictatorship. All the Nazi or
    Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an
    elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and
    critical reasoning. But we must be ready to identify other kinds of
    Newspeak, even if they take the apparently innocent form of a popular talk
    show.
