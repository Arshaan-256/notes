# Politics of Favoritism in Public Procurement in Turkey

*Esra Çeviker Gürakar* (2016)

* As it is put forward by a 2005 International Monetary Fund (IMF)
Report, “corruption in public procurement is the most severe type of
corruption” (IMF, Chapter III, Building Institutions, p.  143).

* A World Trade Organization (WTO) report states that, corruption in government
procurement is “a barrier to development and a scourge on the welfare of
citizens in developing and developed countries alike” (Arrowsmith
and Anderson 2011 p. 685).

* It is also underlined in almost all reports
published by international organizations that transparency as the main tool
to avoid corrupt practices is lacking mainly in the developing states

* Many countries have undertaken extensive reform attempts
in their national procurement systems with an aim to establish a legal
framework in order to enhance transparency, accountability, and
competitiveness. Regulatory reforms, within which independent regulatory
agencies (IRAs) have emerged as key actors, have also been vital as a result of
accelerated globalization and market reforms that transformed the role of
the state. Turkey, which initiated the reform process only after the financial
crisis of 2001 under the supervision of the World Bank (WB) and
IMF, is a latecomer.

* In Turkey, contracting out of the public services to the private sector
via public procurement has been a major tool in supporting the SMEs.
It has also been considered as more efficient and cheaper compared with
the provision of those services by public institutions. Accordingly, public
procurement comprises a substantial part of government spending. One
fourth of annual public spending goes to public procurement. The share
of public procurement in GDP is around 8.5 %. Every year more than hundred
thousand public procurement contracts are awarded to mainly SMEs.

* Yet, public procurement, where government officials and private sector
firms engage in transactions that involve transfers of large sums of money, is
also open to favoritism and corruption. Indeed when public procurement
was regulated under the State Procurement Law (SPL, Law No: 2886)
between 1983 and 2003, the procurement processes were politicized from
within and were not carried out within a transparent framework. As a
result, many irregular and illegal practices and major corruption scandals
emerged in the procurement process (Doğaner 1999; Baran 2000).

* Turkey was required to draft a new Public Procurement Law
(PPL) to replace the State Procurement Law (SPL). The new law was
to be discussed and agreed with the EU and the WB on the basis of the
essential standards of transparency, accountability, and competitiveness set
by the UN Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL Model
Law), which would also formulate a path toward increasing harmonization
with the EU Procurement Directives that is itself bounded by the
WTO’s Plurilateral Agreement on Government Procurement. The policy
makers accepted to reform the public procurement system in line with the
framework required by the international financial institutions (IFIs) and
the EU nexus. This would in turn help them to meet the extensive set of
economic criteria required by the Copenhagen declaration, because they
generally overlapped with the IFIs loan/aid conditionalities. Consequently,
Turkey’s new PPL (Law No. 4734) was passed on January 4, 2002, to be enacted
in January 2003.

* An independent regulatory agency, the Public Procurement Authority (PPA),
has also been established and regulation of public procurement process
was taken from the Ministry of Public Works and Settlements and the
Ministry of Finance (MoF) to be given to the PPA with an aim to foster
transparency and depoliticize the public procurement processes.

* AKP’s success was a by-product of the collective action among the business
spheres of Anatolia who was unhappy about the previous unequal
distribution of rents during the 1980s and 1990s. However, those business
groups whose mental models had been shaped within the existing
institutional structure, perceived themselves as the new insiders or the new
privileged clientele. Hence, they expected AKP to speak this time to their
interests. Regarding the public procurement policy, these business people
strongly opposed the new law and demanded to be outside of its scope. As
a result, the AKP government who initially enthusiastically followed the
EU-initiated reform process in selective areas, such as the civil–military
relations and the judicial institutions, has not preferred to follow through
with the public procurement related reforms. On the contrary, the government
has made numerous controversial changes to the PPL that
diverted the public procurement system from the acquis. Indeed, under
the AKP majority government more than 30 different laws and decrees in
the force of law that made more than 150 amendments to the PPL were
passed in the parliament. With these amendments procurements of several
public institutions have been exempted from the law. Moreover, some
exceptional provisions about certain procurements have been inserted into
the Law (e.g. some procurements shall be made via “restricted procedure”
rather than “open tender”).

* While the number of contracts awarded via open auctions fell from 100,820
(in 2005 to 65,016 in 2014), the number of contracts awarded through less
competitive and less transparent methods and those covered by exceptions rose
from 41,157 to 58,680. In terms of the share in total number of contracts
awarded, these numbers indicate a fall for open auctions from 71% to
52.5%, while a rise for the other tender procedures and the ones covered
under exceptions from 29% to 47.5% (PPA, Procurement Statistics).

* A unique public procurement data set of
49,355 high value (above TL 1 million) public procurement contracts
that has been provided by the Public Procurement Authority of Turkey
is matched with member lists of the four national business associations
and two business confederations representing around 400 other local
and sectoral business associations as well as with a Politically Connected
Firms (PCFs) data set that is manually constructed through identifying the
shareholders and the board members of around 12,000 contract-awarded
firms using the Turkish Trade Registry Gazette.

* The threshold of TL 1 million is chosen confidently because the aggregate
value of all contracts above this threshold forms almost three fourth of the
total value of all procurement contracts awarded.

* A firm is classified as “connected to AKP” (cAKP) if one or more of its
shareholders is/are:
(1) a Member of the Parliament from the ruling AKP; (2) an AKP official
at the local level such as a provincial head or a member of the provincial
party organization; and (3) first degree relative of the ruling party officials
indicated in (1) and (2). Firm shareholders who appear in the media as
close fellow townsmen of the top AKP officials and firms whose shareholders
have political connections with AKP through ideological kinship (e.g.
board members of politically connected media channels, Islamic Charities
and Foundations) are also labeled as cAKP.

* As a result of the investigation of the firms’ political connections,
around 1200 cAKP firms, 1300 PAFs, 321 cOpp firms, 373 TÜSİAD
and TÜRKONFED members, and 475 foreign firms are detected in the
public procurement data set. There are some overlaps among PAFs and
cAKP firms as well as among the TÜSİAD/TÜRKONFED, PAFs and
the cAKP firms. Overlaps between PAFs and cAKP are due to a number
of AKP MPs/officials who are also members or leaders of these four business
associations. The overlaps between TÜSİAD and PAFs stem from
the double-memberships of the established, competitive firms of Anatolia,
known as the “Anatolian Tigers.” There are four firms with one shareholder
politically active in AKP while the other in MHP.

* While I was investigating the contract-awarded firms’ political connections,
I observed that (1) firms participating in procurement auctions,
particularly the cAKP firms, frequently change the names of their firms
especially when the opposition media discovers that the firm is politically
connected; and (2) firm shareholders, particularly the politically connected
ones, establish more than one, usually at least three firms. The underlying
reasons for this tendency are diverse, ranging from participating in tenders
with more firms in order to increase their chances of winning the auction
to having a spare firm for not to lose their chance of participating in
tenders in case of any possible ban from the auctions.

* Politically supported capital accumulation was a significant characteristic
of private sector development in twentieth-century Turkey. Party competition,
particularly in the late 1980s and early 1990s, led the economic
policies to take a more populist character. Populist pressures emerged
from the nature of distributional conflicts. Various governments tried to
mediate these conflicts by distributing the state rents to their respective
constituencies. As the income inequality and regional discrepancy persisted,
the tendency for rent distribution got stronger and became a norm
in the 1980s and the1990s (Eder 2003). Yet, the clientelist elements and
the politicized and corrupt practices that served as major tools for rapid
capital accumulation for particular business groups, indeed proved to be a
threat rather than an opportunity both for the economy and the societal
balance. “The presence of a ‘strong’ and centralized state, with a continued
ability to distribute certain economic resources and political patronage”
(Önis and Türem 2001) led the establishment and development of
“robber coalitions” (İlhan 2014) consisting of politicians, bureaucrats,
business people, and other interest groups. This in turn impeded the
formulation of the most of the socially beneficial, welfare-enhancing policies.

* In Turkey’s corporatist structure, the associational landscape was not
developed either. From 1971 to 1990, Turkey’s voluntary business association
arena was dominated by the Istanbul-based TÜSİAD—a very powerful business
association consisting of the top capital groups of Turkey
and was even sometimes referred to as the “association that toppled the
government” (Arat 1991: 135). TÜSİAD while it remained faithful to
the corporatist and clientelist institutional structure, valued and protected
its status as higher ranking, culturally superior, elitist capitalist club
and remained both non-inclusive to new-comers and non-responsive to
democratization of the associational landscape (İlhan 2014).

* Despite the prevalence of “robber coalitions” and the unequal distribution
of rents, new industrial centers in peripheral Anatolia started to
blossom toward the end of 1980s. These economic developments that
coupled with the rise of political Islam led the emerging peripheral
bourgeoisie, often regarded as “devout” or “conservative,” to become
increasingly more significant actors of state–business relations. In contrast
with Eurocentric and secular characteristic of the conventional Western
cities-based business circles of the Turkish Republic, the new business elite,
originating from Anatolian towns, desired to assert their provincial identity
and to preserve and spread their Islamic values and traditions. Thus,
starting from the early 1990s, they have begun establishing their own
business associations to pursue their common interests in Turkey’s corporatist
structure. They have also started to influence Turkey’s associational
landscape, which had been until then dominated by TÜSİAD. MÜSİAD that was
founded in 1990 by devout entrepreneurs with ties
to Prime Minister Turgut Özal or to Necmettin Erbakan, follower of the
National Islamic View, is the first and the most prominent Islamic business
association in Turkey, representing several large but mainly medium-sized
enterprises.

* The former MÜSİAD President Omer Bolat labels each MÜSİAD member, who needs
to meet a difficult membership criteria consisting of background checks and so
on in order not to “allow bad seeds to thrive in their midst,” as a full-time
MÜSİAD professional, “implying the sworn commitment that each
member is alleged to have made to the association” (İlhan 2014: 149).
A remarkable instance demonstrating this commitment is that in 1997,
about 3,000 MÜSİAD members made financial contributions ranging
from US$10,000 to US$50,000 to establish a new firm called Investment
Partnership Inc. to outbid a TÜSİAD member firm in the privatization
auction of a large privatized state enterprise—the state electricity provider
TEDAŞ

* In 2005, a Gülen Movement-affiliated confederation—TUSKON—and another
noticeable Islamic business association, allegedly close to
Naqshbandi Tariqa—TÜMSİAD—are established.

* As a result, the capitalist interests of the socially religious but
economically liberal business circles have increasingly been represented by
MÜSİAD, TUSKON, TÜMSİAD, and ASKON that are aligned with a
new generation of political Islam and do not hesitate to explicitly link
their affiliation with Islamic faith and ideology. The bourgeoning firms
represented by the Islamic business associations exert influence through
their connections with the ruling AKP. In exchange of political support,
Islamic business associations enjoyed the mediator role of the government
in international business relations, preferential access to state resources,
and privileges in privatization processes (Hoşgör 2011).

* the business leaders of the Muslim community who provided
AKP with strong support also joined and served in different ranks of the
AKP cadres. This tendency became most evident with the rise in the number of
MPs with a business background in the Grand National Assembly of
Turkey (TGNA) after the 2002 elections. In the twenty-second, twenty-third,
and twenty-fourth terms of the TGNA, AKP had fifty, sixty-two,
and sixty-three MPs with business backgrounds ranging from members
or leaders of Islamic business associations, bar associations or chambers
of commerce and industry.

* The majority of the AKP MPs with connections with the Islamic business
associations (member or leader) has mostly been MÜSİAD-affiliated.
ASKON-affiliated business people have been far less present in the parliament.
In the twenty-second, twenty-third, and twenty-fourth terms of the
TGNA, the number of MÜSİAD-affiliate MPs was eleven, seven, and ten,
respectively. Leading MÜSİAD members, Ahmet Edip Uğur, Abdurrahman
Müfit Yetkin, and Vahit Kiler, have been elected to the TGNA for three
consecutive terms. Nevertheless, in the 2007 elections significant names of
TUSKON such as Tahir Öztürk, Orhan Karasayar, and Kayhan Türkmenoğlu
were elected as MPs from AKP.  Of the three TUSKON-affiliated MPs,
Orhan Karasayar was reelected in 2011 and 2015 and Tahir Öztürk in
2015. Kayhan Türkmenoğlu ran for November, 2015 Elections from AKP,
but was not elected to the Parliament. Finally, one ASKON-affiliated and
two TÜMSİAD-affiliated AKP MPs, Hüseyin Üzülmez, Önder Matlı, and
Nesrin Ulema appeared in the TGNA in the twenty-fourth term.

* Becoming an MP is not a common practice among the TÜSİAD members.
On the contrary, TÜSİAD member firms are not even allowed to
have MPs or bureaucrats in their board of directors—a decision made
after the recurrent corruption scandals of the 1990s that included several
names from the TÜSİAD members along with the ministers, MPs, and
bureaucrats.

* Firms in Turkey form direct connections with the majority government
through joining local-level politics from AKP cadres as members
of municipal councils or party provincial organizations. The immediate
relatives some of these local AKP officials are also active in the public
procurement market.

* Dynamics at the local-level politics appear to be particularly interesting
as “taking sides in politics has become a determinant of entrepreneurial
success” (Buğra and Savaşkan 2014: 100) in “new” Turkey. Consequently,
local politics has turned to be an arena where pork-barrel politics has
become widespread in both Parliamentary and Local elections.

* In addition, particularly
during the pre-election periods BİTs, through the municipal procurement
contracts (e.g. municipal cleaning contracts), are used for creating
employment opportunities for potential voters.

* Public procurement in Turkey was governed under the SPL (Law No.
2886) between 1983 and 2003. The SPL, which was amended only in
1984 since its enactment, had many shortcomings stemming from its
outdated, incomprehensive, non-specific, and unclear provisions. It was
also evidently not aligned with the internationally recognized legislative
framework, such as those of UNCITRAL, the WTO, and the EU. Various
domestic business groups, the media, the IFIs, the local and the international
NGOs, as well as the EU heavily criticized the Turkey’s public
procurement system on the grounds that it was discriminatory and paving way
for widespread favoritism and corruption.

* The SPL had a very limited scope covering only the municipalities, special
provincial administrations, and public institutions included in the general
budget and annexed budget. Procurements of a significant number of
public agencies were exempted from the scope of the law. These agencies
could issue their own regulations on procurements with the approval of
the Council of Ministers. Such a system in which several procuring entities
regulated their procurement activities with separate legislations was
unsurprisingly vulnerable to irregular and illegal transfers.
As a result, there were dozens of different regulations covering different
types of procurements of various procuring entities. This significantly
hampered competition as potential tenderers were unable to follow with the
practices and requirements of various public agencies.

* For tenders that were required to be advertised, advertising procedures
varied depending on the value of the contract. Procurement notices for
tenders whose values exceed the limits determined by the annual budget law,
had to be advertised in a daily newspaper published in a major
city. Contracts whose estimated value exceeded three times the annually
published amount had to be published in the Official Gazette. For tenders
below these limits, announcement had to be made in  local newspapers where
available otherwise on the procuring entity’s notice board.

However, one major problem with the publicity requirements was that the
SPL required ten-days notification period for domestic tenders, regardless
of the procurement method or of the value of the contract. Tender
notification periods were thus too short to inform interested firms and
did not provide the bidders with sufficient time to prepare their bids,
particularly for high-value tenders, hence curbing transparency and
competition.

* Indeed, the system was initially designed to award the contracts to the
best candidates with successful past performance records and high professional
capacities as the certificates were supposed to be given only to qualified
contractors. Yet, the system had loopholes as MPWS bureaucrats who
spent a sufficient amount of time in auditing public works construction
projects were also awarded with carnets. Thus in practice, firms could buy
or hire carnets from bureaucrats. As the carnets could be transferred, the
contracts of high-value public works projects were awarded to unqualified
but favored firms. Even firms that had not even built a single brick wall
could hire one of these certificates in the rental market that was formed
by the commission agents clustered around the MPWS (Doğaner 1999;
World Bank 2001a). This flawed system of qualifying contractors, which was
certainly open
to abuse both by public officials and the private firms, eventually led
thousands of fake companies to acquire those certificates but not always for
the purpose of winning a procurement contract. Some used to ask for
“compensation” from tendering companies in return for not participating in
an auction to reduce the contract price. Others used to establish
additional firms in order to rent extra certificates. When a contractor
participated in an auction with multiple firms, competition was reduced or
avoided.

* Furthermore, because the unit rates for public works were revised
annually by the MPWS and the new, higher rates automatically applied to
all ongoing works contracts, a common practice used by contractors was
slowing down their performance toward the end of the year in order to
take advantage of the unit price increases.

* Apparently, this flawed system of public procurement served the interests
of the politicians of Turkey. Particularly, public works procurement
projects were prepared in accordance with reelection concerns, rather
than the national or regional necessities. The politicians prioritized rent
creation and distribution to their business constituencies over the macro
targets, plan objectives, and the budgetary constraints. As a result,
initiation of an excessive number of projects relative to the financial
resources available, which was legally warranted by the Contract Price
Escalation clause of the SPL, became a commonplace. The parliament members
could run from one groundbreaking ceremony to another and transform
the country to a construction site despite the funds was not enough for
all the projects. The fact that excessive increases in contract prices became
a standard practice particularly in public works procurements also raised
doubts about widespread favoritism and corrupt practices. Yet, as funds
were not available when price difference payments fell due, many public works
construction projects that had commenced with groundbreaking ceremonies of
pre-elections period either could not be completed or
ran late by several years, or sometimes even decades.

* The sub-stantial shortfalls in planned investment expenditures were also
evidenced by the WB report which stated that the public-sector investment
projects that consisted of 5,321 projects with an estimated cost of US$150
billion initiated during the period between 1983 and 1999 had an unfinished
balance of US$105 billion (equal to 70 % of the estimated total cost of
projects in the public investment portfolio) and that the portfolio of that
time would take, on average, 10.5 years to complete (World Bank 2001a: 14).

<!-- Editleme işi burada kaldı. -->

* One example demonstrating the persistent weaknesses of the public
procurement system in Turkey associated with the lack of a comprehen-
sive evaluation process conducted on the basis of explicit administrative,
technical, and financial criteria was about a state penitentiary construction
project in Kars, a city in East-Anatolia region. There was no sufficient fund
for the project, but the politicians of the time ordered the bureaucrats
to estimate the cost of the project much lower than the real cost and to
initiate the tender process. The public works procurement was contracted
in 1987 by the Ministry of Justice. Unsurprisingly, the available funds
petered out in 1992 when only the one-fifth of the building construction
was completed. A price difference could be paid to the contractor, but
the procurement law mandated that the amount was not to exceed the 30
% of the contract value. Thus, given that the price difference would not
be enough to complete the project, the contract was abolished in 1992.
Another five more years passed with legal battles between the ministry and
the constructor company. During this period, weather conditions of the
eastern provinces of Turkey destroyed the derelict unfinished building. By
1997, the cost of the incomplete penitentiary construction project to the
public was hundredfold of the initial estimated cost! (“Fiyasko”).

* The price escalation clause of the SPL gave rise not only to the incom-
plete projects stemming from irresponsible procurement action by the
public officials and the contractor firms, but also corrupt transfers between
these actors. Several ministers such as the former Ministers of Public
Works Koray Aydin and Yasar Topcu and the former Minsiters of Energy
and Natural Resources Cumhur Ersumer and Zeki Cakan were sent to
the Supreme Court for corruption charges related to illegal installation of
price differences amounting to 600 % of the initial contract price (Anayasa
Mahkemesi).

* The former Minister of Public Works Koray Aydin, for instance, was
sent to the Supreme Court also for his illegal practices of Article 44 for
nineteen tenders. Aydin was blamed for misuse of the clause about the
projects that have “esthetic and technical specifications” for regular public
works tenders such as constructions of lodging, hospitals, and schools.1
The minister was also accused of illegal appropriation of wealth in ten
separate bidding tenders. The Chief Prosecutor for the Turkish Supreme
Court Nuri Ok claimed that the former Minister approved the use of
untransparent auction methods for twenty-nine procurements with an
aim to award the firms of his choice with contracts. Aydin’s defense was
even more tragic: He argued that when the preceding Minister of Public
Works had been in office, the ratio of restricted procedure to mandated
closed-bidding procedure had been much higher—around 90 % (Anayasa
Mahkemesi).

* Given that the SPL required the procuring entities to advertise the tender
notice ten days before the auction, which was by all means not a sufficient
period for the firms to get informed and organize the necessary docu-
ments to participate in auctions; such a restrictive arrangement naturally
paved a way for discretion and corruption in the public procurement mar-
ket. That is, the public officials could prepare the list in such a way (e.g.
requiring unnecessary financial or material qualifications) that only one or
a few firms could get prepared in a short period of time and participate in
the auction.

* The second mechanism that was used to avoid the relatively more
transparent closed-bidding procedure was canceling the tender proceed-
ings. The tender board’s decision on the award of contract was subject
to review within fifteen days by the head of the procuring entity, who
could approve or cancel an auction outcome without even justifying his or
her decision. Alternatively, the tender committee could reject all the ten-
ders and cancel the tender proceedings. The committee had to justify its
decision. The most widely used justification ground was that the tenders
were not consistent with the market values. According to the SPL Article
43, if a tender was canceled due to bids that significantly varied from the
market values, the second auction for the planned procurement could be
conducted using the negotiated procedure. Yet, the negotiated procedure
was the most discretionary auction method. The procuring entities could
negotiate freely with all invited bidders without being bounded by written
rules. Publication of tender notice was also not required for procurements
that would be made under the negotiated procedure (SPL, Article 5).

* Moreover, the WB reported that the bid protest system was not only
flawed, but the firms that tried to use the system experienced worsened
relations with procuring entities rather than reaching acceptable solu-
tions. Thus, the bidders, who were “worried about damaging their future
business prospects with their public-sector clients, hardly ever registered
protests against contract award decisions.” They rather used other ways
and means, such as establishing connections with public officials “which is
evidenced by public officials’ interference in the procurement process, in
return for ‘facilitation payments’ for such favors.” (World Bank 2001a: 17)

* Koray Aydın,
the Minister of Public Works and Settlement, who was later sent to the
Supreme Court on corruption charges, strongly opposed the require-
ments put forward by the EU and the WB authorities. One major area of
conflict was about establishment of an independent PPA.

* Eighth, the notorious carnet system has been abolished. The MPWS
lost the authority for awarding carnets. In addition, all carnets that had
been previously awarded by the Ministry would all not be enforceable by
2003 (“Bütçede ödeneği olmayan”). The new arrangement led legal bat-
 ̇tles between the Ministry and the PPA (“Ihale Kurumu Bakanlık”). As a
result of bureaucratic resistance, a relatively more tolerable system, within
which certificates of experience would be awarded according to a set of
performance criteria, was introduced. Accordingly, the new law provided
that documents proving experience in supervision or management of at
least 80 % of the contract value of works conducted within the last fifteen
years can be used for the evaluation of professional and technical qualifica-
tions of the tenderers.

* The significant change in Turkey’s political landscape with a political
party named AK, meaning clean, unblemished, and uncorrupt, forming
the single-party government with MPs consist of Islamist opinion and
business leaders who praise values such as equality, justice, and moral-
ity boosted public expectations on more equal social and economic poli-
cies and more transparent and uncorrupt practices. These lifted optimistic
expectations got even stronger with the increased prospects for joining
the EU when Turkey started the membership negotiations with the EU in
2005. Yet, Turkey’s corporatist and clientelist policy-making structure has
soon proven to be resistant to change. It has indeed been strengthened by
the dominant coalition of the “Islamist counter-elite”7 consisting of the
devout bourgeoisie active in politics in AKP cadres and/or in business in
Islamic business associations.

* AKP, which initially enthusiastically followed the reform process in selec-
tive areas (e.g. civil–military relations), did not put an effort in overcom-
ing the structural problems associated with the existence and persistence
of clientelist and corporatist elements in the economy. Power had shifted
hands, and the ones who for the first time gained political power wanted
to distribute rents this time to their clientele who regarded winning public
procurement contracts as a way to expand their accumulation basis and
further integrate with the world market.

* As the market potential of Turkey has increased with the existence of
more trade opportunities elsewhere and the importance of the EU coun-
tries as trade partners partly decreased particularly after the global cri-
sis, the effect of third-party enforcement has diminished. This, together
with and the country’s overall positive growth performance, and easing
IMF-debt with regular installments and not signing any other stand-by
agreements with the IMF after the last one signed in 2005, have pro-
vided the government with a larger room for maneuvering and increased
Turkey’s bargaining power. Interestingly, the improved capabilities were
initially built, to a large extent, through the country’s strong ties with
the EU. But, they also allowed the country to reposition itself in accor-
dance with the shifts in global conditions and in the domestic power bal-
ances (Esfahani and Gürakar 2013).

* The majority of the rest were laws about
  different public institutions (e.g. Conservation of Cultural and Natural
  Property [5226]; Universiade Law [5255]; Law on Witness Protection
  [5726]; Law on Foundations [5737]; Primary Education Law [6287])
  that also had articles about changing the PPL.

  [Tanık koruma kanununda neden kamu ihaleleriyle alakalı madde var?]

* in 2004 the media revealed
that the Social Security Institution (SSK) had purchased medical supplies
with a contract value four times higher than their normal value. The PPA
held the SSK bureaucrats responsible for not implementing the rules and
procedures of the law, whereas the latter blamed the former for requiring
unnecessary paperwork which made the procurement process inefficient
via impeding to ask discounts from the producers as they used to do when
they had done their procurements under the old SPL

* Two months later, the media discovered a grant
corruption scandal in procurements of the Ministry of Education (MoE).
The PPA reviewed the MoE tenders and sent the files of suspected pro-
curement cases to the Prime Ministry to be investigated (“Sıfırcı Eğitim”).
The president of the PPA in an interview in a daily journal claimed that
the MoE, Huseyin Celik, had threatened himself and the rest of the PPA
officials that he would find “something” wrong about PPA practices and
launch an investigation

* in 2006, the media outlets began reporting on the handwritten notes of
the former Justice Minister Sadullah Ergin in which the planned pub-
lic tenders were divided among the firms close to the AKP.  The media
revealed that the majority of the public procurement contracts tendered
in Hatay in 2006 were indeed awarded to local AKP administrators. This
came to be known as the “Ali Dibo” scandal (“Dört Yıldır Aynı”). The
PPA launched an investigation into 190 of the public tenders and decided
that they were all illegal (“145 ihale mevzuata aykırı”). The prime minister
called the president of the PPA, who was continuously canceling the alleg-
edly irregular procurement auctions, and told him, “I promise people for
projects and ask them for their votes, I am accountable to the public, not
you.”

* with a series of laws the authority of PPA to review the
public allegations about public procurement as well as appeal applications
when a tender is canceled was abandoned. Instead, the PPA has been lim-
ited only with reviewing the appeal applications. The amendments made
to the methods of appointment, the period of duty and opportunity to be
reappointed to the PPB have been the other major changes that curtailed
the independence of the PPA (“Kurullara tek tip elbise”). The number
of its members has been reduced from ten to nine. The term in office
has been shortened from five to four years. The clause that banned the
reelection of PPB members has been removed and replaced with the sen-
tence “A member can be elected more than once,” curbing the indepen-
dence of the PPB members through making them repeat-players (Kamu
 ̇
 ̇
Ihale Kanunu Ile). This in turn raised doubts about the possibility that
the PPB members with reelection concerns would prefer to be loyal to
the government and act in line with the demands of the political author-
ity. Furthermore, another clause that banned individuals who previously
had political experience, including being nominated as an MP candidate
by a political party, has also been removed from the law. Moreover, with
another amendment the Council of Ministers has been given the authority
to appoint the members of the Board on the proposal of the MoF. The
Council of Ministers has also been authorized to appoint the Chairperson
and Deputy Chairperson of the PPA (Avrupa Birliği Bakanlığının, KHK
649). An additional clause inserted into the law has made it possible for
the Minister of Finance to appoint three vice presidents in order to assist

the new president of the PPA, who had the framed photos of the Minister
of Finance in his office, was asked about his opinion about the amend-
ments that curbed the autonomy of the PPA (e.g. through abandoning its
role to review the irregularity claims ex officio), he made an unexpected
declaration that the mission of the PPA was not fighting with corruption

* Meanwhile, in 2013, with another amendment law (Law no. 6459),
the Criminal Code Law (Law no. 5237) has been amended and sen-
tence reductions—from 5–12 years to 3–7 years imprisonment—have
been declared for conducting procurement fraud. More interestingly, the
amendment law was drafted and proposed to the TGNA by the opposi-
tion party (CHP) and accepted by the governing party

* Public procurement comprises a substantial part of government spending
in Turkey. Every year more than a hundred thousand public procurement
contracts are awarded to more than 50,000 firms that are mainly the small
and medium enterprises (SMEs). One fourth of annual public spending
goes to public procurement. Its share in GDP is around 8.5 %.

* In Turkey, twenty-eight different public institutions, ranging from
municipalities to health and education ministries, conduct procurement
auctions and award contracts. The Municipalities are the largest con-
tractors followed by the SOEs and the Ministry of Health. These three
institutions together account for more than 50 % of all procurements con-
tracts awarded. In terms of the regional distribution of public procure-
ment contracts, Istanbul and Ankara together account for almost half of
all procurements.

* the rise in total
value of high-value public procurements stem from the significant jump in
the construction projects, whose share in total value of procurements rose
from 39 % in 2004 to 57 % in 2011. This rise that emerged at the expense
of a fall in goods procurement, whose share in total procurement dropped
from 33 % to 16 % during the same period, reflects the priority of construc-
tion sector in the policy agenda of the government and the close relations
between the contractors and the politicians. It is indeed a well-known
fact and widely revealed in the media that large contractor firms finance
politics in Turkey

* Apart from a few big holding companies that are active in diverse sec-
tors, the contract-awarded firms usually operate in one of the three sec-
tors: the manufacturing, services, and the construction sectors. Among
these 14,000 firms, 1,203 of them have direct connections with the ruling
AKP, whereas 323 of them have political connections with the opposition
parties represented in the TGNA or in the local governmental bodies.
There are four firms with one shareholder connected to AKP, whereas the
other to MHP. About 1,303 other firms have some sort of political affilia-
tion with AKP through their membership to Islamic business associations
which provides the AKP government with immense political support and
in return benefit from some “opportunity spaces”2 and privileges created
by the government.

* Another 376 contract-awarded firms are members of busi-
ness associations that are not known to have harmonic relations with AKP.
They indeed, from time to time, went in several conflicts with the party
and its policies. An additional 475 foreign firms also win procurement
contracts in Turkey. Finally, there are 9,787 contract-awarded domestic
firms with no political connections and membership to business associa-
tions studied in this book.

* More interestingly, the data set includes several
village headmen (mukhtars) who were awarded with millions-worth pro-
curement contracts, probably demonstrating the importance of mukhtars
for the government and makes a bit easier to understand why Tayyip
Erdoğan organizes meetings with “selected” mukhtars.

* CHP-connected firms are awarded with contracts
mainly by the municipalities of the coastal regions of Turkey governed
by CHP. MHP-connected firms however get the contracts from various
state institutions due the party’s presence and power in state bureaucracy,
which has not petered out during the AKP period. In addition to the
CHP- and MHP-connected firms, there exist fewer (around twenty-five)
contract-awarded firms connected to DTP and BDP (the Kurdish politi-
cal parties). They get the contracts from the municipalities of the South
Eastern part of the country, which are governed by the Kurdish parties.
Nevertheless, the cAKP firms still get the highest share from the procure-
ments conducted in the region, even in Diyarbakır.

* In terms of value of contracts, firms
that have direct political connections with the ruling AKP get around
38 % of all contracts. Firms with direct connections with the opposition
parties, however, get a mere 6 %. In addition, PAFs get another 17 %,
while the members of TÜSIAD and TÜRKONFED together get 13 %
of the contracts. Finally, foreign firms get around 4 % of the contracts.

* The “local others” indeed won 45 % of the 49,355 procurement
auctions. Yet, the value share of these contracts accounts only one fourth
of the total value of all contracts. The PCFs, however win the other 45 %
of all contracts, but their value share in total accounts for almost 60 % of
the value of all procurement contracts.

* 3,600 of 4,000 firms that
are awarded with contracts with a total value of TL 1–2 million, are the
“local others.” Only 250 PCFs (cAKP, cOpp, and PAFs combined) were
awarded with contracts with a total of TL 1–2 million.

* One-third of the TÜSIAD-TF members reach a total contract value
between TL 5 and 25 million each, while the other one-third get contracts
amounting to a total of TL 25–500 million per firm. The ones who
won a single bid with a total value of TL 1–2 million are generally the
TÜRKONFED member firms of Anatolia, whereas the ones that were
awarded with contracts totaling to more than TL 500 million and indeed
 ̇
reaching to billions, are Istanbul-based famous TÜSIAD member holding
companies.

* TOKI has become directly affiliated with the
Prime Ministry under the Presidency’s approval (dated January 15, 2004).
 ̇
Moreover, TOKI investments have been removed from state investment
programs and exempted from PPL. What is more, all the duties and the
 ̇
authority of the Urban Land Office have been transferred to TOKI,
with the Law no. 5273 (dated December 14, 2004). Based on this legal
 ̇
arrangement, 64.5 million m2 of land has been passed on TOKI’s immov-
 ̇
able portfolio. Having had considerable amount of state land, TOKI has
started to cooperate with the private sector through joint ventures.
 ̇
Moreover, TOKI is permanently exempted from land tax. It is also
bestowed with numerous other powers and privileges through a dozen of
laws such as establishing subsidiary firms, implementing profit oriented
projects, drafting and approving urban renewal projects, and conducting
renovation projects in preservation zones

* TOKI is not being audited by the Court of Accounts. Until
December 2010, all the Administration’s accounts were audited by the
High Council Audit Office, which was itself attached to the prime min-
 ̇
ister. TOKI reported “directly to the Prime Minister’s Office rather than
being part of the general administrative bureaucracy.”

* “Maybe he is corrupt, but he at least built highways towards my hometown.”
This is a sentence that you can hear from any average voter in Turkey. As
depicted in Voigtlaender and Voth’s (2014) stimulating paper “Highway
to Hitler” where they show that the Autobahn building was highly effec-
tive in reducing opposition to the Hitler regime, Turkey experienced a
similar trend in the AKP era where highway construction played a signifi-
cant role in contributing AKP’s power consolidation attempts and at the
same time distribute state resources to affiliated firms.

* Construction of 15,000 km double lane highways was the most notable
pre-election promises of AKP. Since AKP came to power, although con-
struction of new highways was not the case as the total length of the high-
ways in Turkey rose from 1,714 to 2,127 kilometers, dividing and paving
works were significant. During the analysis period, the length of divided
roads rose from 6,000 km to 22,000 km, whereas the length of unpaved
roads, including village roads, fell from 144,000  km to 33,000  km

* Foreign firms are almost non-existent in “Tigers” municipal procurement
market, with the exception of Kayseri, where two high-value tram pro-
curement contracts were awarded to the foreign firms due to the lack of
related technology.

* Firms that are politically con-
nected to the AKP government get three-fourth of the contracts awarded
by the AKP-governed municipalities. What is interesting is that CHP-
governed Izmir Municipality also exercises discretion in favor of the
firms politically connected to the main opposition party. Almost half of
the procurement contracts awarded by the Izmir municipality, although
much less than the total value of contracts awarded by AKP-governed
Istanbul and Ankara municipalities (TL 7 billion for Izmir vs. 46 billion
for Istanbul and Ankara municipalities in total) were given to the cOpp
firms. The two CHP MPs who were interviewed about the issue and
asked why the tendency is similar in a CHP-governed municipality, said
that because AKP is exercising excessive control both at central and local
levels, firms that are not affiliated with the AKP are put in a disadvanta-
geous position, through numerous legal arrangements that impede com-
petition. In such an uncompetitive environment, the Izmir municipality,
the MPs argue, are left with no other options other than protecting these
firms.

* If rather the related policy making
was based on economic rationale, the cost of all procurements to public
would be much lower than its current total. For instance, it would be TL
2.5 billion lower if the rebate for tenders won by cAKP firms would be
equal to the corresponding value for the average rebate of tenders won
 ̇
by the average of non-connected local firms including the TÜSIAD and
TÜRKONFED members. This public loss is only the burden of political
clientelism in tender processes. It does not even include the price dif-
ferences paid to the contract-awarded contractor firms during the con-
struction period.

* In the pre-AKP period, corruption in public procure-
ment used to occur mainly at individual levels via abusing the loopholes in
the deficient SPL. In the AKP period, however, the majority government
has used public procurement as an influential tool both to increase its
electoral success and build its own, loyal elites. As a result, corruption is
centralized and exists and prevails through making highly debated, notori-
ous new laws and regulations.

* Establishing, preserving and developing a set of extensive networks of
privileges and dependency networks have become AKPs main channels
through which the party has both built a new “loyal” business class and
maintained its ties with the voters using new methods of redistribution.
Public procurement is one of the most influential tools used by the
AKP majority government.

* Public procurement in Turkey appear to function as not only a rent
creation and distribution mechanism but also as a vote machine as the
two main sectors—services and construction, where the PCFs are mostly
awarded with contracts, are immediate sources of various socioeconomic
outcomes such as newly constructed or repaired highways, railways,
social housing, as well as increased employment opportunities for low-
skill employees as contracts workers in the services and the construction
sector. Through the social housing projects, construction of highways,
and municipal services, the AKP government has both managed to touch
upon the very lives of the voters and at the same time distribute rents to
“politically connected” private sector firms. AKP’s machine-like organiza-
tion is one of the utmost underlying reasons of AKP’s durability in spite
of increasing corruption, decreasing civil liberties, and deterioration in
democratization.
