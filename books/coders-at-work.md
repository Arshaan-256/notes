**Seibel:** And you studied computers in college but didn't major in computer
science, right?

**Norvig:** When I started, the computer classes were part of the applied-math
department. By the time I graduated there actually was a computer science
department, but I stuck with math as my major. **It felt like doing all the
requirements for a computer science major was like majoring in IBM.** You had
to learn their assembly language, you had to learn their 360 operating system,
and so on. *That didn't seem like much fun.* There were some some courses that
I liked and I took those, but I didn't want to go through all the requirements.

After college I worked for two years, for a software company in Cambridge. And
after two years I said, *"It took me four years to get sick of school and only
two years to get sick of work, maybe I like school twice as much."*
