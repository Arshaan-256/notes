During the 1960s, researchers at Cornell University conducted a series of
tests on the effects of working with music.

To no one's surprise, participants in the two rooms [silent room and room
with earphones+music] performed about the same in speed and accuracy of
programming.

The Cornell experiment, however, contained a hidden wild card. The
specification required that an output data stream be formed through a series
of manipulations on numbers in the input data stream.

Although the specification never said it, the net effect of all the
operations was that each output number was necessarily equal to its input
number. Some people realized this and others did not. Of those who figured
it out, the overwhelming majority came from the quiet room.Many of the
everyday tasks performed by professional workers are done in the serial
processing center of the left brain. Music will not interfere particularly
with this work, since it's the brain's holistic right side that digests
music. But not all of the work is centered in the left brain. 

The creative leap involves right-brain function. If the right brain is busy
listening to 1001 Strings on Muzak, the opportunity for a creative leap is
lost.
