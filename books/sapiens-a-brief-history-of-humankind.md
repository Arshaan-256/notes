* 500 The Scientific Revolution. Humankind admits its ignorance and begins to
  acquire unprecedented power. Europeans begin to conquer America and the
  oceans. The entire planet becomes a single historical arena. The rise of
  capitalism.
* ABOUT 13.5 BILLION YEARS AGO, MATTER, energy, time and space came into being
  in what is known as the Big Bang. The story of these fundamental features of
  our universe is called physics.
* About 300,000 years after their appearance, matter and energy started to
  coalesce into complex structures, called atoms, which then combined into
  molecules. The story of atoms, molecules and their interactions is called
  chemistry.
* About 3.8 billion years ago, on a planet called Earth, certain molecules
  combined to form particularly large and intricate structures called organisms.
  The story of organisms is called biology.
* Three important revolutions shaped the course of history: the Cognitive
  Revolution kick-started history about 70,000 years ago. The Agricultural
  Revolution sped it up about 12,000 years ago. The Scientific Revolution, which
  got under way only 500 years ago, may well end history and start something
  completely different.
* There were humans long before there was history.
* On a hike in East Africa 2 million years ago, you might well have encountered
  a familiar cast of human characters: anxious mothers cuddling their babies and
  clutches of carefree children playing in the mud; temperamental youths chafing
  against the dictates of society and weary elders who just wanted to be left in
  peace; chest-thumping machos trying to impress the local beauty and wise old
  matriarchs who had already seen it all.
* These archaic humans loved, played, formed close friendships and competed for
  status and power – but so did chimpanzees, baboons and elephants. There was
  nothing special about humans.
* The most important thing to know about prehistoric humans is that they were
  insignificant animals with no more impact on their environment than gorillas,
  fireflies or jellyfish.
* Species that evolved from a common ancestor are bunched together under the
  heading ‘genus’ (plural genera). Lions, tigers, leopards and jaguars are
  different species within the genus Panthera. Biologists label organisms with a
  two-part Latin name, genus followed by species. Lions, for example, are called
  Panthera leo, the species leo of the genus Panthera. Presumably, everyone
  reading this book is a Homo sapiens – the species sapiens (wise) of the
  genus Homo (man).
* Genera in their turn are grouped into families, such as the cats (lions,
  cheetahs, house cats), the dogs (wolves, foxes, jackals) and the elephants
  (elephants, mammoths, mastodons).
* All cats, for example, from the smallest house kitten to the most ferocious
  lion, share a common feline ancestor who lived about 25 million years ago.
* Homo sapiens long preferred to view itself as set apart from animals, an
  orphan bereft of family, lacking siblings or cousins, and most importantly,
  without parents. But that’s just not the case. Like it or not, we are
  members of a large and particularly noisy family called the great apes.
* Our closest living relatives include chimpanzees, gorillas and orang-utans.
  The chimpanzees are the closest. Just 6 million years ago, a single female ape
  had two daughters. One became the ancestor of all chimpanzees, the other is
  our own grandmother.
* Humans first evolved in East Africa about 2.5 million years ago from an
  earlier genus of apes called Australopithecus, which means ‘Southern Ape’.
  About 2 million years ago, some of these archaic men and women left their
  homeland to journey through and settle vast areas of North Africa, Europe and
  Asia.
* Humans in Europe and western Asia evolved into Homo neanderthalensis (‘Man
  from the Neander Valley’), popularly referred to simply as
  ‘Neanderthals’.
* Neanderthals, bulkier and more muscular than us Sapiens, were well adapted to
  the cold climate of Ice Age western Eurasia.
* The more eastern regions of Asia were populated by Homo erectus, ‘Upright
  Man’, who survived there for close to 2 million years, making it the most
  durable human species ever.
* It is doubtful whether Homo sapiens will still be around a thousand years from
  now, so 2 million years is really out of our league.
* On the island of Java, in Indonesia, lived Homo soloensis, ‘Man from the
  Solo Valley’, who was suited to life in the tropics.
* On another Indonesian island – the small island of Flores – archaic humans
  underwent a process of dwarfing. Humans first reached Flores when the sea
  level was exceptionally low, and the island was easily accessible from the
  mainland. When the seas rose again, some people were trapped on the island,
  which was poor in resources. Big people, who need a lot of food, died first.
  Smaller fellows survived much better. Over the generations, the people of
  Flores became dwarves. This unique species, known by scientists as Homo
  floresiensis, reached a maximum height of only 3.5 feet and weighed no more
  than fifty-five pounds. They were nevertheless able to produce stone tools,
  and even managed occasionally to hunt down some of the island’s elephants
  – though, to be fair, the elephants were a dwarf species as well.
* In 2010 another lost sibling was rescued from oblivion, when scientists
  excavating the Denisova Cave in Siberia discovered a fossilised finger bone.
  Genetic analysis proved that the finger belonged to a previously unknown human
  species, which was named Homo denisova. Who knows how many lost relatives of
  ours are waiting to be discovered in other caves, on other islands, and in
  other climes.
* The cradle of humanity continued to nurture numerous new species, such as Homo
  rudolfensis, ‘Man from Lake Rudolf’, Homo ergaster, ‘Working Man’, and
  eventually our own species, which we’ve immodestly named Homo sapiens,
  ‘Wise Man’.
* It’s a common fallacy to envision these species as arranged in a straight
  line of descent, with Ergaster begetting Erectus, Erectus begetting the
  Neanderthals, and the Neanderthals evolving into us. This linear model gives
  the mistaken impression that at any particular moment only one type of human
  inhabited the earth, and that all earlier species were merely older models of
  ourselves. The truth is that from about 2 million years ago until around
  10,000 years ago, the world was home, at one and the same time, to several
  human species.
* The earth of a hundred millennia ago was walked by at least six different
  species of man.
* The earliest men and women, 2.5 million years ago, had brains of about 36
  cubic inches. Modern Sapiens sport a brain averaging 73–85 cubic inches.
  Neanderthal brains were even bigger.
* In Homo sapiens, the brain accounts for about 2–3 per cent of total body
  weight, but it consumes 25 per cent of the body’s energy when the body is at
  rest.
* By comparison, the brains of other apes require only 8 per cent of rest-time
  energy.
* The first evidence for tool production dates from about 2.5 million years ago,
  and the manufacture and use of tools are the criteria by which archaeologists
  recognise ancient humans.
* Humankind paid for its lofty vision and industrious hands with backaches and
  stiff necks.
* Women paid extra. An upright gait required narrower hips, constricting the
  birth canal – and this just when babies’ heads were getting bigger and
  bigger. Death in childbirth became a major hazard for human females. Women who
  gave birth earlier, when the infant’s brain and head were still relatively
  small and supple, fared better and lived to have more children. Natural
  selection consequently favoured earlier births. And, indeed, compared to other
  animals, humans are born prematurely, when many of their vital systems are
  still under-developed. A colt can trot shortly after birth; a kitten leaves
  its mother to forage on its own when it is just a few weeks old. Human babies
  are helpless, dependent for many years on their elders for sustenance,
  protection and education.
* We assume that a large brain, the use of tools, superior learning abilities
  and complex social structures are huge advantages. It seems self-evident that
  these have made humankind the most powerful animal on earth. But humans
  enjoyed all of these advantages for a full 2 million years during which they
  remained weak and marginal creatures. Thus humans who lived a million years
  ago, despite their big brains and sharp stone tools, dwelt in constant fear of
  predators, rarely hunted large game, and subsisted mainly by gathering plants,
  scooping up insects, stalking small animals, and eating the carrion left
  behind by other more powerful carnivores.
* One of the most common uses of early stone tools was to crack open bones in
  order to get to the marrow. Some researchers believe this was our original
  niche. Just as woodpeckers specialise in extracting insects from the trunks of
  trees, the first humans specialised in extracting marrow from bones. Why
  marrow? Well, suppose you observe a pride of lions take down and devour a
  giraffe. You wait patiently until they’re done. But it’s still not your
  turn because first the hyenas and jackals – and you don’t dare interfere
  with them – scavenge the leftovers. Only then would you and your band dare
  approach the carcass, look cautiously left and right – and dig into the
  edible tissue that remained.
* This is a key to understanding our history and psychology. Genus Homo’s
  position in the food chain was, until quite recently, solidly in the middle.
  For millions of years, humans hunted smaller creatures and gathered what they
  could, all the while being hunted by larger predators. It was only 400,000
  years ago that several species of man began to hunt large game on a regular
  basis, and only in the last 100,000 years – with the rise of Homo sapiens
  – that man jumped to the top of the food chain.
* That spectacular leap from the middle to the top had enormous consequences.
  Other animals at the top of the pyramid, such as lions and sharks, evolved
  into that position very gradually, over millions of years. This enabled the
  ecosystem to develop checks and balances that prevent lions and sharks from
  wreaking too much havoc. As lions became deadlier, so gazelles evolved to run
  faster, hyenas to cooperate better, and rhinoceroses to be more bad-tempered.
  In contrast, humankind ascended to the top so quickly that the ecosystem was
  not given time to adjust. Moreover, humans themselves failed to adjust. Most
  top predators of the planet are majestic creatures. Millions of years of
  dominion have filled them with self-confidence. Sapiens by contrast is more
  like a banana republic dictator. Having so recently been one of the underdogs
  of the savannah, we are full of fears and anxieties over our position, which
  makes us doubly cruel and dangerous. Many historical calamities, from deadly
  wars to ecological catastrophes, have resulted from this over-hasty jump.
* A significant step on the way to the top was the domestication of fire. Some
  human species may have made occasional use of fire as early as 800,000 years
  ago. By about 300,000 years ago, Homo erectus, Neanderthals and the
  forefathers of Homo sapiens were using fire on a daily basis.
* Not long afterwards, humans may even have started deliberately to torch their
  neighbourhoods. A carefully managed fire could turn impassable barren thickets
  into prime grasslands teeming with game. In addition, once the fire died down,
  Stone Age entrepreneurs could walk through the smoking remains and harvest
  charcoaled animals, nuts and tubers.
* Fire not only changed food’s chemistry, it changed its biology as well.
  Cooking killed germs and parasites that infested food. Humans also had a far
  easier time chewing and digesting old favourites such as fruits, nuts, insects
  and carrion if they were cooked. Whereas chimpanzees spend five hours a day
  chewing raw food, a single hour suffices for people eating cooked food.
* The advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less
  time to eating, and to make do with smaller teeth and shorter intestines.
* Some scholars believe there is a direct link between the advent of cooking,
  the shortening of the human intestinal track, and the growth of the human
  brain.
* Eagles, for example, identify thermal columns rising from the ground, spread
  their giant wings and allow the hot air to lift them upwards. Yet eagles
  cannot control the location of the columns, and their maximum carrying
  capacity is strictly proportional to their wingspan.
* Despite the benefits of fire, 150,000 years ago humans were still marginal
  creatures. They could now scare away lions, warm themselves during cold
  nights, and burn down the occasional forest. Yet counting all species
  together, there were still no more than perhaps a million humans living
  between the Indonesian archipelago and the Iberian peninsula, a mere blip on
  the ecological radar.
* Our own species, Homo sapiens, was already present on the world stage, but so
  far it was just minding its own business in a corner of Africa. We don’t
  know exactly where and when animals that can be classified as Homo sapiens
  first evolved from some earlier type of humans, but most scientists agree that
  by 150,000 years ago, East Africa was populated by Sapiens that looked just
  like us. If one of them turned up in a modern morgue, the local pathologist
  would notice nothing peculiar.
* Scientists also agree that about 70,000 years ago, Sapiens from East Africa
  spread into the Arabian peninsula, and from there they quickly overran the
  entire Eurasian landmass.
* When Homo sapiens landed in Arabia, most of Eurasia was already settled by
  other humans.
* What happened to them? There are two conflicting theories. The
  ‘Interbreeding Theory’ tells a story of attraction, sex and mingling. As
  the African immigrants spread around the world, they bred with other human
  populations, and people today are the outcome of this interbreeding.
* For example, when Sapiens reached the Middle East and Europe, they encountered
  the Neanderthals. These humans were more muscular than Sapiens, had larger
  brains, and were better adapted to cold climes. They used tools and fire, were
  good hunters, and apparently took care of their sick and infirm.
* (Archaeologists have discovered the bones of Neanderthals who lived for many
  years with severe physical handicaps, evidence that they were cared for by
  their relatives.)
* Neanderthals are often depicted in caricatures as the archetypical brutish and
  stupid ‘cave people’, but recent evidence has changed their image.
* According to the Interbreeding Theory, when Sapiens spread into Neanderthal
  lands, Sapiens bred with Neanderthals until the two populations merged. If
  this is the case, then today’s Eurasians are not pure Sapiens. They are a
  mixture of Sapiens and Neanderthals. Similarly, when Sapiens reached East
  Asia, they interbred with the local Erectus, so the Chinese and Koreans are a
  mixture of Sapiens and Erectus.
* The opposing view, called the ‘Replacement Theory’ tells a very different
  story – one of incompatibility, revulsion, and perhaps even genocide.
* According to this theory, Sapiens and other humans had different anatomies,
  and most likely different mating habits and even body odours. They would have
  had little sexual interest in one another. And even if a Neanderthal Romeo and
  a Sapiens Juliet fell in love, they could not produce fertile children,
  because the genetic gulf separating the two populations was already
  unbridgeable. The two populations remained completely distinct, and when the
  Neanderthals died out, or were killed off, their genes died with them.
  According to this view, Sapiens replaced all the previous human populations
  without merging with them. If that is the case, the lineages of all
  contemporary humans can be traced back, exclusively, to East Africa, 70,000
  years ago.
* If the Replacement Theory is correct, all living humans have roughly the same
  genetic baggage, and racial distinctions among them are negligible.
* But if the Interbreeding Theory is right, there might well be genetic
  differences between Africans, Europeans and Asians that go back hundreds of
  thousands of years.
* In recent decades the Replacement Theory has been the common wisdom in the
  field. It had firmer archaeological backing, and was more politically correct
  (scientists had no desire to open up the Pandora’s box of racism by claiming
  significant genetic diversity among modern human populations).
* But that ended in 2010, when the results of a four-year effort to map the
  Neanderthal genome were published. Geneticists were able to collect enough
  intact Neanderthal DNA from fossils to make a broad comparison between it and
  the DNA of contemporary humans. The results stunned the scientific community.
  It turned out that 1–4 per cent of the unique human DNA of modern
  populations in the Middle East and Europe is Neanderthal DNA. That’s not a
  huge amount, but it’s significant.
* A second shock came several months later, when DNA extracted from the
  fossilised finger from Denisova was mapped. The results proved that up to 6
  per cent of the unique human DNA of modern Melanesians and Aboriginal
  Australians is Denisovan DNA.
* Since Neanderthals and Denisovans contributed only a small amount of DNA to
  our present-day genome, it is impossible to speak of a ‘merger’ between
  Sapiens and other human species. Although differences between them were not
  large enough to completely prevent fertile intercourse, they were sufficient
  to make such contacts very rare.
* It seems that about 50,000 years ago, Sapiens, Neanderthals and Denisovans
  were at that borderline point. They were almost, but not quite, entirely
  separate species.
* It is unsettling – and perhaps thrilling – to think that we Sapiens could
  at one time have sex with an animal from a different species, and produce
  children together.
* But if the Neanderthals, Denisovans and other human species didn’t merge
  with Sapiens, why did they vanish? One possibility is that Homo sapiens drove
  them to extinction.
* Imagine a Sapiens band reaching a Balkan valley where Neanderthals had lived
  for hundreds of thousands of years. The newcomers began to hunt the deer and
  gather the nuts and berries that were the Neanderthals’ traditional staples.
  Sapiens were more proficient hunters and gatherers – thanks to better
  technology and superior social skills – so they multiplied and spread. The
  less resourceful Neanderthals found it increasingly difficult to feed
  themselves. Their population dwindled and they slowly died out, except perhaps
  for one or two members who joined their Sapiens neighbours.
* Another possibility is that competition for resources flared up into violence
  and genocide. Tolerance is not a Sapiens trademark. In modern times, a small
  difference in skin colour, dialect or religion has been enough to prompt one
  group of Sapiens to set about exterminating another group. Would
* It may well be that when Sapiens encountered Neanderthals, the result was the
  first and most significant ethnic-cleansing campaign in history.
* Imagine how things might have turned out had the Neanderthals or Denisovans
  survived alongside Homo sapiens. What kind of cultures, societies and
  political structures would have emerged in a world where several different
  human species coexisted? How, for example, would religious faiths have
  unfolded? Would the book of Genesis have declared that Neanderthals descend
  from Adam and Eve, would Jesus have died for the sins of the Denisovans, and
  would the Qur’an have reserved seats in heaven for all righteous humans,
  whatever their species? Would Neanderthals have been able to serve in the
  Roman legions, or in the sprawling bureaucracy of imperial China? Would the
  American Declaration of Independence hold as a self-evident truth that all
  members of the genus Homo are created equal? Would Karl Marx have urged
  workers of all species to unite?
* When Charles Darwin indicated that Homo sapiens was just another kind of
  animal, people were outraged. Even today many refuse to believe it. Had the
  Neanderthals survived, would we still imagine ourselves to be a creature
  apart? Perhaps this is exactly why our ancestors wiped out the Neanderthals.
  They were too familiar to ignore, but too different to tolerate.
* Whether Sapiens are to blame or not, no sooner had they arrived at a new
  location than the native population became extinct.
* The last remains of Homo soloensis are dated to about 50,000 years ago. Homo
  denisova disappeared shortly thereafter. Neanderthals made their exit roughly
  30,000 years ago. The last dwarf-like humans vanished from Flores Island about
  12,000 years ago.
* They also left behind us, Homo sapiens, the last human species.
* in the first recorded encounter between Sapiens and Neanderthals, the
  Neanderthals won. About 100,000 years ago, some Sapiens groups migrated north
  to the Levant, which was Neanderthal territory, but failed to secure a firm
  footing. It might have been due to nasty natives, an inclement climate, or
  unfamiliar local parasites. Whatever the reason, the Sapiens eventually
  retreated, leaving the Neanderthals as masters of the Middle East.
* This poor record of achievement has led scholars to speculate that the
  internal structure of the brains of these Sapiens was probably different from
  ours. They looked like us, but their cognitive abilities – learning,
  remembering, communicating – were far more limited. Teaching such an ancient
  Sapiens English, persuading him of the truth of Christian dogma, or getting
  him to understand the theory of evolution would probably have been hopeless
  undertakings. Conversely, we would have had a very hard time learning his
  language and understanding his way of thinking.
* beginning about 70,000 years ago, Homo sapiens started doing very special
  things. Around that date Sapiens bands left Africa for a second time. This
  time they drove the Neanderthals and all other human species not only from the
  Middle East, but from the face of the earth.
* About 45,000 years ago, they somehow crossed the open sea and landed in
  Australia – a continent hitherto untouched by humans. The period from about
  70,000 years ago to about 30,000 years ago witnessed the invention of boats,
  oil lamps, bows and arrows and needles (essential for sewing warm clothing).
  The first objects that can reliably be called art date from this era (see the
  Stadel lion-man in this chapter), as does the first clear evidence for
  religion, commerce and social stratification.
* If we were to come across the artists of the Stadel Cave, we could learn their
  language and they ours. We’d be able to explain to them everything we know
  – from the adventures of Alice in Wonderland to the paradoxes of quantum
  physics – and they could teach us how their people view the world.
* The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between 70,000 and
  30,000 years ago, constitutes the Cognitive Revolution.
* What caused it? We’re not sure. The most commonly believed theory argues
  that accidental genetic mutations changed the inner wiring of the brains of
  Sapiens, enabling them to think in unprecedented ways and to communicate using
  an altogether new type of language. We might call it the Tree of Knowledge
  mutation.
* Why did it occur in Sapiens DNA rather than in that of Neanderthals? It was a
  matter of pure chance, as far as we can tell.
* Many animals, including all ape and monkey species, have vocal languages. For
  example, green monkeys use calls of various kinds to communicate. Zoologists
  have identified one call that means, ‘Careful! An eagle!’ A slightly
  different call warns, ‘Careful! A lion!’ When researchers played a
  recording of the first call to a group of monkeys, the monkeys stopped what
  they were doing and looked upwards in fear.
* When the same group heard a recording of the second call, the lion warning,
  they quickly scrambled up a tree.
* A parrot can say anything Albert Einstein could say, as well as mimicking the
  sounds of phones ringing, doors slamming and sirens wailing. Whatever
  advantage Einstein had over a parrot, it wasn’t vocal. What, then, is so
  special about our language? The most common answer is that our language is
  amazingly supple. We can connect a limited number of sounds and signs to
  produce an infinite number of sentences, each with a distinct meaning.
* A second theory agrees that our unique language evolved as a means of sharing
  information about the world. But the most important information that needed to
  be conveyed was about humans, not about lions and bison.
* Our language evolved as a way of gossiping. According to this theory Homo
  sapiens is primarily a social animal. Social cooperation is our key for
  survival and reproduction.
* It is not enough for individual men and women to know the whereabouts of lions
  and bison. It’s much more important for them to know who in their band hates
  whom, who is sleeping with whom, who is honest, and who is a cheat.
* The amount of information that one must obtain and store in order to track the
  ever-changing relationships of even a few dozen individuals is staggering. (In
  a band of fifty individuals, there are 1,225 one-on-one relationships, and
  countless more complex social combinations.)
* All apes show a keen interest in such social information, but they have
  trouble gossiping effectively. Neanderthals and archaic Homo sapiens probably
  also had a hard time talking behind each other’s backs – a much maligned
  ability which is in fact essential for cooperation in large numbers.
* The new linguistic skills that modern Sapiens acquired about seventy millennia
  ago enabled them to gossip for hours on end. Reliable information about who
  could be trusted meant that small bands could expand into larger bands, and
  Sapiens could develop tighter and more sophisticated types of cooperation.1
* The gossip theory might sound like a joke, but numerous studies support it.
  Even today the vast majority of human communication – whether in the form of
  emails, phone calls or newspaper columns – is gossip. It comes so naturally
  to us that it seems as if our language evolved for this very purpose.
* Most likely, both the gossip theory and the there-is-a-lion-near-the-river
  theory are valid.
* Yet the truly unique feature of our language is not its ability to transmit
  information about men and lions. Rather, it’s the ability to transmit
  information about things that do not exist at all. As far as we know, only
  Sapiens can talk about entire kinds of entities that they have never seen,
  touched or smelled.
* Legends, myths, gods and religions appeared for the first time with the
  Cognitive Revolution. Many animals and human species could previously say,
  ‘Careful! A lion!’ Thanks to the Cognitive Revolution, Homo sapiens
  acquired the ability to say, ‘The lion is the guardian spirit of our
  tribe.’ This ability to speak about fictions is the most unique feature of
  Sapiens language.
* You could never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him
  limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven.
* Sapiens can cooperate in extremely flexible ways with countless numbers of
  strangers. That’s why Sapiens rule the world, whereas ants eat our leftovers
  and chimps are locked up in zoos and research laboratories.
* When two males are contesting the alpha position, they usually do so by
  forming extensive coalitions of supporters, both male and female, from within
  the group. Ties between coalition members are based on intimate daily contact
  – hugging, touching, kissing, grooming and mutual favours. Just as human
  politicians on election campaigns go around shaking hands and kissing babies,
  so aspirants to the top position in a chimpanzee group spend much time
  hugging, back-slapping and kissing baby chimps.
* The alpha male usually wins his position not because he is physically
  stronger, but because he leads a large and stable coalition.
* Researchers have documented prolonged warfare between groups, and even one
  case of ‘genocidal’ activity in which one troop systematically slaughtered
  most members of a neighbouring band.2
* In the wake of the Cognitive Revolution, gossip helped Homo sapiens to form
  larger and more stable bands.
* But even gossip has its limits. Sociological research has shown that the
  maximum ‘natural’ size of a group bonded by gossip is about 150
  individuals. Most people can neither intimately know, nor gossip effectively
  about, more than 150 human beings.
* Even today, a critical threshold in human organisations falls somewhere around
  this magic number. Below this threshold, communities, businesses, social
  networks and military units can maintain themselves based mainly on intimate
  acquaintance and rumour-mongering. There is no need for formal ranks, titles
  and law books to keep order.3
* The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers
  can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths.
* Any large-scale human cooperation – whether a modern state, a medieval
  church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe – is rooted in common myths that
  exist only in people’s collective imagination.
* There are no gods in the universe, no nations, no money, no human rights, no
  laws, and no justice outside the common imagination of human beings.
* Two lawyers who have never met can nevertheless combine efforts to defend a
  complete stranger because they both believe in the existence of laws, justice,
  human rights – and the money paid out in fees.
* People easily understand that ‘primitives’ cement their social order by
  believing in ghosts and spirits, and gathering each full moon to dance
  together around the campfire. What we fail to appreciate is that our modern
  institutions function on exactly the same basis.
* Modern business-people and lawyers are, in fact, powerful sorcerers. The
  principal difference between them and tribal shamans is that modern lawyers
  tell far stranger tales.
* In the US, the technical term for a limited liability company is a
  ‘corporation’, which is ironic, because the term derives from ‘corpus’
  (‘body’ in Latin) – the one thing these corporations lack.
* How exactly did Armand Peugeot, the man, create Peugeot, the company? In much
  the same way that priests and sorcerers have created gods and demons
  throughout history, and in which thousands of French curés were still
  creating Christ’s body every Sunday in the parish churches. It all revolved
  around telling stories, and convincing people to believe them.
* how does one convince millions of people to believe particular stories about
  gods, or nations, or limited liability companies? Yet when it succeeds, it
  gives Sapiens immense power, because it enables millions of strangers to
  cooperate and work towards common goals.
* Just try to imagine how difficult it would have been to create states, or
  churches, or legal systems if we could speak only about things that really
  exist, such as rivers, trees and lions.
* Green monkeys and chimpanzees can lie. A green monkey, for example, has been
  observed calling ‘Careful! A lion!’ when there was no lion around. This
  alarm conveniently frightened away a fellow monkey who had just found a
  banana, leaving the liar all alone to steal the prize for itself.
* Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens have thus been living in a dual
  reality. On the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and lions;
  and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and corporations.
  As time went by, the imagined reality became ever more powerful, so that today
  the very survival of rivers, trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined
  entities such as the United States and Google.
* Under the right circumstances myths can change rapidly. In 1789 the French
  population switched almost overnight from believing in the myth of the divine
  right of kings to believing in the myth of the sovereignty of the people.
* Animal behaviour is also influenced by environmental factors and individual
  quirks. Nevertheless, in a given environment, animals of the same species will
  tend to behave in a similar way. Significant changes in social behaviour
  cannot occur, in general, without genetic mutations.
* For example, common chimpanzees have a genetic tendency to live in
  hierarchical groups headed by an alpha male. Members of a closely related
  chimpanzee species, bonobos, usually live in more egalitarian groups dominated
  by female alliances. Female common chimpanzees cannot take lessons from their
  bonobo relatives and stage a feminist revolution. Male chimps cannot gather in
  a constitutional assembly to abolish the office of alpha male and declare that
  from here on out all chimps are to be treated as equals.
* Such dramatic changes in behaviour would occur only if something changed in
  the chimpanzees’ DNA.
* As far as we can tell, changes in social patterns, the invention of new
  technologies and the settlement of alien habitats resulted from genetic
  mutations and environmental pressures more than from cultural initiatives.
* This is why it took humans hundreds of thousands of years to make these steps.
* As long as Homo erectus did not undergo further genetic alterations, its stone
  tools remained roughly the same – for close to 2 million years!
* In contrast, ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens have been able to
  change their behaviour quickly, transmitting new behaviours to future
  generations without any need of genetic or environmental change.
* In other words, while the behaviour patterns of archaic humans remained fixed
  for tens of thousands of years, Sapiens could transform their social
  structures, the nature of their interpersonal relations, their economic
  activities and a host of other behaviours within a decade or two.
* Consider a resident of Berlin, born in 1900 and living to the ripe age of one
  hundred. She spent her childhood in the Hohenzollern Empire of Wilhelm II; her
  adult years in the Weimar Republic, the Nazi Third Reich and Communist East
  Germany; and she died a citizen of a democratic and reunified Germany. She had
  managed to be a part of five very different sociopolitical systems, though her
  DNA remained exactly the same.
* This was the key to Sapiens’ success. In a one-on-one brawl, a Neanderthal
  would probably have beaten a Sapiens. But in a conflict of hundreds,
  Neanderthals wouldn’t stand a chance. Neanderthals could share information
  about the whereabouts of lions, but they probably could not tell – and
  revise – stories about tribal spirits. Without an ability to compose
  fiction, Neanderthals were unable to cooperate effectively in large numbers,
  nor could they adapt their social behaviour to rapidly changing challenges.
* Sapiens bands that lived on the island of New Ireland, north of New Guinea,
  used a volcanic glass called obsidian to manufacture particularly strong and
  sharp tools. New Ireland, however, has no natural deposits of obsidian.
  Laboratory tests revealed that the obsidian they used was brought from
  deposits on New Britain, an island 250 miles away. Some of the inhabitants of
  these islands must have been skilled navigators who traded from island to
  island over long distances.5
* We may presume that Neanderthals were not pleased to see their traditional
  hunting grounds turned into Sapiens-controlled slaughterhouses.
* The immense diversity of imagined realities that Sapiens invented, and the
  resulting diversity of behaviour patterns, are the main components of what we
  call ‘cultures’. Once cultures appeared, they never ceased to change and
  develop, and these unstoppable alterations are what we call ‘history’.
* We are still animals, and our physical, emotional and cognitive abilities are
  still shaped by our DNA. Our societies are built from the same building blocks
  as Neanderthal or chimpanzee societies, and the more we examine these building
  blocks – sensations, emotions, family ties – the less difference we find
  between us and other apes.
* Physiologically, there has been no significant improvement in our tool-making
  capacity over the last 30,000 years. Albert Einstein was far less dexterous
  with his hands than was an ancient hunter-gatherer. However, our capacity to
  cooperate with large numbers of strangers has improved dramatically.
* As far as we know, the people who carved the Stadel lion-man some 30,000 years
  ago had the same physical, emotional and intellectual abilities we have.
* The flourishing field of evolutionary psychology argues that many of our
  present-day social and psychological characteristics were shaped during this
  long pre-agricultural era. Even today, scholars in this field claim, our
  brains and minds are adapted to a life of hunting and gathering. Our eating
  habits, our conflicts and our sexuality are all the result of the way our
  hunter-gatherer minds interact with our current post-industrial environment,
  with its mega-cities, aeroplanes, telephones and computers.
* The instinct to gorge on high-calorie food was hard-wired into our genes.
  Today we may be living in high-rise apartments with over-stuffed
  refrigerators, but our DNA still thinks we are in the savannah. That’s what
  makes some of us spoon down an entire tub of Ben & Jerry’s when we find one
  in the freezer and wash it down with a jumbo Coke.
* There are even a number of present-day human cultures in which collective
  fatherhood is practised, as for example among the Barí Indians. According to
  the beliefs of such societies, a child is not born from the sperm of a single
  man, but from the accumulation of sperm in a woman’s womb.
* A good mother will make a point of having sex with several different men,
  especially when she is pregnant, so that her child will enjoy the qualities
  (and paternal care) not merely of the best hunter, but also of the best
  storyteller, the strongest warrior and the most considerate lover.
* If this sounds silly, bear in mind that before the development of modern
  embryological studies, people had no solid evidence that babies are always
  sired by a single father rather than by many.
* Artefacts made of more perishable materials – such as wood, bamboo or
  leather – survive only under unique conditions. The common impression that
  pre-agricultural humans lived in an age of stone is a misconception based on
  this archaeological bias. The Stone Age should more accurately be called the
  Wood Age, because most of the tools used by ancient hunter-gatherers were made
  of wood.
* One good example is the huge variety the first European settlers found among
  the Aborigine peoples of Australia. Just before the British conquest, between
  300,000 and 700,000 hunter-gatherers lived on the continent in 200–600
  tribes, each of which was further divided into several bands.2 Each tribe had
  its own language, religion, norms and customs.
* For example, there’s every reason to believe that a forager band that lived
  30,000 years ago on the spot where Oxford University now stands would have
  spoken a different language from one living where Cambridge is now situated.
* Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, there hasn’t been a single natural way
  of life for Sapiens. There are only cultural choices, from among a bewildering
  palette of possibilities.
* Today, the society called New Zealand is composed of 4.5 million Sapiens and
  50 million sheep.
* There was just one exception to this general rule: the dog. The dog was the
  first animal domesticated by Homo sapiens, and this occurred before the
  Agricultural Revolution. Experts disagree about the exact date, but we have
  incontrovertible evidence of domesticated dogs from about 15,000 years ago.
  They may have joined the human pack thousands of years earlier.
* It seems safe to say that the vast majority of people lived in small bands
  numbering several dozen or at most several hundred individuals, and that all
  these individuals were humans. It is important to note this last point,
  because it is far from obvious. Most members of agricultural and industrial
  societies are domesticated animals.
* Simultaneously, dogs learned to manipulate people for their own needs. A
  15,000-year bond has yielded a much deeper understanding and affection between
  humans and dogs than between humans and any other animal.4 In some cases dead
  dogs were even buried ceremoniously, much like humans.
* The Sapiens population was thinly spread over vast territories. Before the
  Agricultural Revolution, the human population of the entire planet was smaller
  than that of today’s Cairo.
* If a forager band split once every forty years and its splinter group migrated
  to a new territory sixty miles to the east, the distance from East Africa to
  China would have been covered in about 10,000 years.
* Most importantly, alongside seas and rivers rich in seafood and waterfowl,
  humans set up permanent fishing villages – the first permanent settlements
  in history, long predating the Agricultural Revolution. Fishing villages might
  have appeared on the coasts of Indonesian islands as early as 45,000 years
  ago. These may have been the base from which Homo sapiens launched its first
  transoceanic enterprise: the invasion of Australia.
* Notwithstanding the popular image of ‘man the hunter’, gathering was
  Sapiens’ main activity, and it provided most of their calories, as well as
  raw materials such as flint, wood and bamboo.
* You could survive and pass your unremarkable genes to the next generation by
  working as a water carrier or an assembly-line worker.
* When agriculture and industry came along people could increasingly rely on the
  skills of others for survival, and new ‘niches for imbeciles’ were opened
  up.
* The hunter-gatherer way of life differed significantly from region to region
  and from season to season, but on the whole foragers seem to have enjoyed a
  more comfortable and rewarding lifestyle than most of the peasants, shepherds,
  labourers and office clerks who followed in their footsteps.
* While people in today’s affluent societies work an average of forty to
  forty-five hours a week, and people in the developing world work sixty and
  even eighty hours a week, hunter-gatherers living today in the most
  inhospitable of habitats – such as the Kalahari Desert – work on average
  for just thirty-five to forty-five hours a week.
* Today, a Chinese factory hand leaves home around seven in the morning, makes
  her way through polluted streets to a sweatshop, and there operates the same
  machine, in the same way, day in, day out, for ten long and mind-numbing
  hours, returning home around seven in the evening in order to wash dishes and
  do the laundry. Thirty thousand years ago, a Chinese forager might leave camp
  with her companions at, say, eight in the morning. They’d roam the nearby
  forests and meadows, gathering mushrooms, digging up edible roots, catching
  frogs and occasionally running away from tigers. By early afternoon, they were
  back at the camp to make lunch. That left them plenty of time to gossip, tell
  stories, play with the children and just hang out. Of course the tigers
  sometimes caught them, or a snake bit them, but on the other hand they
  didn’t have to deal with automobile accidents and industrial pollution.
* Evidence from fossilised skeletons indicates that ancient foragers were less
  likely to suffer from starvation or malnutrition, and were generally taller
  and healthier than their peasant descendants.
* Average life expectancy was apparently just thirty to forty years, but this
  was due largely to the high incidence of child mortality. Children who made it
  through the perilous first years had a good chance of reaching the age of
  sixty, and some even made it to their eighties.
* Most of the infectious diseases that have plagued agricultural and industrial
  societies (such as smallpox, measles and tuberculosis) originated in
  domesticated animals and were transferred to humans only after the
  Agricultural Revolution.
* When a valued band member died, the Aché customarily killed a little girl and
  buried the two together.
* When an old Aché woman became a burden to the rest of the band, one of the
  younger men would sneak behind her and kill her with an axe-blow to the head.
* An Aché man told the inquisitive anthropologists stories of his prime years
  in the jungle. ‘I customarily killed old women. I used to kill my aunts . .
  . The women were afraid of me . . . Now, here with the whites, I have become
  weak.’
* Babies born without hair, who were considered underdeveloped, were killed
  immediately.
* One woman recalled that her first baby girl was killed because the men in the
  band did not want another girl.
* On another occasion a man killed a small boy because he was ‘in a bad mood
  and the child was crying’. Another child was buried alive because ‘it was
  funny-looking and the other children laughed at it’. 7
* Anthropologists who lived with them for years report that violence between
  adults was very rare. Both women and men were free to change partners at will.
  They smiled and laughed constantly, had no leadership hierarchy, and generally
  shunned domineering people. They were extremely generous with their few
  possessions, and were not obsessed with success or wealth. The things they
  valued most in life were good social interactions and high-quality
  friendships.8
* It should also be noted that the Aché were hunted and killed without mercy by
  Paraguayan farmers.
* Just as there is no barrier between humans and other beings, neither is there
  a strict hierarchy. Non-human entities do not exist merely to provide for the
  needs of man. Nor are they all-powerful gods who run the world as they wish.
  The world does not revolve around humans or around any other particular group
  of beings.
* The generic rubric ‘theists’ covers Jewish rabbis from eighteenth-century
  Poland, witch-burning Puritans from seventeenth-century Massachusetts, Aztec
  priests from fifteenth-century Mexico, Sufi mystics from twelfth-century Iran,
  tenth-century Viking warriors, second-century Roman legionnaires, and first-
  century Chinese bureaucrats.
* Each of these viewed the others’ beliefs and practices as weird and
  heretical.
* the Sungir children are among the best pieces of evidence that 30,000 years
  ago Sapiens could invent sociopolitical codes that went far beyond the
  dictates of our DNA and the behaviour patterns of other human and animal
  species.
* during pre-industrial warfare more than 90 per cent of war dead were killed by
  starvation, cold and disease rather than by
* weapons.
* In Portugal, a survey was made of 400 skeletons from the period immediately
  predating the Agricultural Revolution. Only two skeletons showed clear marks
  of violence. A similar survey of 400 skeletons from the same period in Israel
  discovered a single crack in a single skull that could be attributed to human
  violence. A third survey of 400 skeletons from various pre-agricultural sites
  in the Danube Valley found evidence of violence on eighteen skeletons.
  Eighteen out of 400 may not sound like a lot, but it’s actually a very high
  percentage. If all eighteen indeed died violently, it means that about 4.5 per
  cent of deaths in the ancient Danube Valley were caused by human violence.
  Today, the global average is only 1.5 per cent, taking war and crime together.
* During the twentieth century, only 5 per cent of human deaths resulted from
  human violence – and this in a century that saw the bloodiest wars and most
  massive genocides in history.
* The depressing findings from the Danube Valley are supported by a string of
  equally depressing findings from other areas. At Jabl Sahaba in Sudan, a
  12,000-year-old cemetery containing fifty-nine skeletons was discovered.
  Arrowheads and spear points were found embedded in or lying near the bones of
  twenty-four skeletons, 40 per cent of the find. The skeleton of one woman
  revealed twelve injuries.
* In Ofnet Cave in Bavaria, archaeologists discovered the remains of thirty-
  eight foragers, mainly women and children, who had been thrown into two burial
  pits. Half the skeletons, including those of children and babies, bore clear
  signs of damage by human weapons such as clubs and knives. The few skeletons
  belonging to mature males bore the worst marks of violence. In all
  probability, an entire forager band was massacred at Ofnet.
* The foragers may have had their all-conquering Napoleons, who ruled empires
  half the size of Luxembourg; gifted Beethovens who lacked symphony orchestras
  but brought people to tears with the sound of their bamboo flutes; and
  charismatic prophets who revealed the words of a local oak tree rather than
  those of a universal creator god.
* Trekkers visiting the Siberian tundra, the deserts of central Australia and
  the Amazonian rainforest believe that they have entered pristine landscapes,
  virtually untouched by human hands. But that’s an illusion. The foragers
  were there before us and they brought about dramatic changes even in the
  densest jungles and the most desolate wildernesses.
* The wandering bands of storytelling Sapiens were the most important and most
  destructive force the animal kingdom had ever produced.
* PRIOR TO THE COGNITIVE REVOLUTION, humans of all species lived exclusively on
  the Afro-Asian landmass.
* The most reasonable theory suggests that, about 45,000 years ago, the Sapiens
  living in the Indonesian archipelago (a group of islands separated from Asia
  and from each other by only narrow straits) developed the first seafaring
  societies. They learned how to build and manoeuvre ocean-going vessels and
  became long-distance fishermen, traders and explorers.
* The Sapiens in Indonesia, descendants of apes who lived on the African
  savannah, became Pacific seafarers without growing flippers and without having
  to wait for their noses to migrate to the top of their heads as whales did.
  Instead, they built boats and learned how to steer them. And these skills
  enabled them to reach and settle Australia.
* rising sea levels have buried the ancient Indonesian shoreline under 300 feet
  of ocean).
* The journey of the first humans to Australia is one of the most important
  events in history, at least as important as Columbus’ journey to America or
  the Apollo II expedition to the moon. It was the first time any human had
  managed to leave the Afro-Asian ecological system – indeed, the first time
  any large terrestrial mammal had managed to cross from Afro-Asia to Australia.
* The moment the first hunter-gatherer set foot on an Australian beach was the
  moment that Homo sapiens climbed to the top rung in the food chain on a
  particular landmass and thereafter became the deadliest species in the annals
  of planet Earth.
* Within a few thousand years, virtually all of these giants vanished. Of the
  twenty-four Australian animal species weighing 100 pounds or more, twenty-
  three became extinct.2 A large number of smaller species also disappeared.
  Food chains throughout the entire Australian ecosystem were broken and
  rearranged. It was the most important transformation of the Australian
  ecosystem for millions of years. Was it all the fault of Homo sapiens?
* In particular, our planet has experienced numerous cycles of cooling and
  warming. During the last million years, there has been an ice age on average
  every 100,000 years. The last one ran from about 75,000 to 15,000 years ago.
* when climate change causes mass extinctions, sea creatures are usually hit as
  hard as land dwellers.
* Human involvement can easily explain why the wave of extinction obliterated
  the terrestrial megafauna of Australia while sparing that of the nearby
  oceans. Despite its burgeoning navigational abilities, Homo sapiens was still
  overwhelmingly a terrestrial menace.
* mass extinctions akin to the archetypal Australian decimation occurred again
  and again in the ensuing millennia – whenever people settled another part of
  the Outer World.
* The Maoris, New Zealand’s first Sapiens colonisers, reached the islands
  about 800 years ago. Within a couple of centuries, the majority of the local
  megafauna was extinct, along with 60 per cent of all bird species.
* the historical record makes Homo sapiens look like an ecological serial
  killer.
* Large animals – the primary victims of the Australian extinction – breed
  slowly. Pregnancy is long, offspring per pregnancy are few, and there are long
  breaks between pregnancies. Consequently, if humans cut down even one
  diprotodon every few months, it would be enough to cause diprotodon deaths to
  outnumber births. Within a few thousand years the last, lonesome diprotodon
  would pass away, and with her the entire species.4
* Various human species had been prowling and evolving in Afro-Asia for 2
  million years. They slowly honed their hunting skills, and began going after
  large animals around 400,000 years ago.
* But there are certainly good reasons to believe that if Homo sapiens had never
  gone Down Under, it would still be home to marsupial lions, diprotodons and
  giant kangaroos.
* The extinction of the Australian megafauna was probably the first significant
  mark Homo sapiens left on our planet.
* Homo sapiens was the first and only human species to reach the western
  hemisphere landmass, arriving about 16,000 years ago, that is in or around
  14,000 BC.
* The first Americans arrived on foot, which they could do because, at the time,
  sea levels were low enough that a land bridge connected north-eastern Siberia
  with north-western Alaska.
* The human blitzkrieg across America testifies to the incomparable ingenuity
  and the unsurpassed adaptability of Homo sapiens. No other animal had ever
  moved into such a huge variety of radically different habitats so quickly,
  everywhere using virtually the same genes.6
* American fauna 14,000 years ago was far richer than it is today. When the
  first Americans marched south from Alaska into the plains of Canada and the
  western United States, they encountered mammoths and mastodons, rodents the
  size of bears, herds of horses and camels, oversized lions and dozens of large
  species the likes of which are completely unknown today, among them fearsome
  sabre-tooth cats and giant ground sloths that weighed up to eight tons and
  reached a height of twenty feet.
* But no longer. Within 2,000 years of the Sapiens arrival, most of these unique
  species were gone. According to current estimates, within that short interval,
  North America lost thirty-four out of its forty-seven genera of large mammals.
  South America lost fifty out of sixty.
* At the time of the Cognitive Revolution, the planet was home to about 200
  genera of large terrestrial mammals weighing over 100 pounds. At the time of
  the Agricultural Revolution, only about a hundred remained.
* Homo sapiens drove to extinction about half of the planet’s big beasts long
  before humans invented the wheel, writing, or iron tools.
* The tragedy opens with a scene showing a rich and varied population of large
  animals, without any trace of humans. In scene two, Sapiens appear, evidenced
  by a human bone, a spear point, or perhaps a potsherd. Scene three quickly
  follows, in which men and women occupy centre stage and most large animals,
  along with many smaller ones, are gone.
* The elephant birds and the giant lemurs, along with most of the other large
  animals of Madagascar, suddenly vanished about 1,500 years ago – precisely
  when the first humans set foot on the island.
* Archaeologists have discovered on even the tiniest islands evidence of the
  existence of birds, insects and snails that lived there for countless
  generations, only to vanish when the first human farmers arrived.
* None but a few extremely remote islands escaped man’s notice until the
  modern age, and these islands kept their fauna intact. The Galapagos Islands,
  to give one famous example, remained uninhabited by humans until the
  nineteenth century, thus preserving their unique menagerie, including their
  giant tortoises, which, like the ancient diprotodons, show no fear of humans.
* Don’t believe tree-huggers who claim that our ancestors lived in harmony
  with nature. Long before the Industrial Revolution, Homo sapiens held the
  record among all organisms for driving the most plant and animal species to
  their extinctions. We have the dubious distinction of being the deadliest
  species in the annals of biology.
* If we knew how many species we’ve already eradicated, we might be more
  motivated to protect those that still survive.
* If things continue at the present pace, it is likely that whales, sharks, tuna
  and dolphins will follow the diprotodons, ground sloths and mammoths to
  oblivion. Among all the world’s large creatures, the only survivors of the
  human flood will be humans themselves, and the farmyard animals that serve as
  galley slaves in Noah’s Ark.
* The transition to agriculture began around 9500–8500 BC in the hill country
  of south-eastern Turkey, western Iran, and the Levant.
* Wheat and goats were domesticated by approximately 9000 BC; peas and lentils
  around 8000 BC; olive trees by 5000 BC; horses by 4000 BC; and grapevines in
  3500 BC.
* Some animals and plants, such as camels and cashew nuts, were domesticated
  even later, but by 3500 BC the main wave of domestication was over. Even
  today, with all our advanced technologies, more than 90 per cent of the
  calories that feed humanity come from the handful of plants that our ancestors
  domesticated between 9500 and 3500 BC – wheat, rice, maize (called
  ‘corn’ in the US), potatoes, millet and barley.
* No noteworthy plant or animal has been domesticated in the last 2,000 years.
* Today, scholars agree that agriculture sprang up in other parts of the world
  not by the action of Middle Eastern farmers exporting their revolution but
  entirely independently.
* The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the
  disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet
  or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered
  elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a
  worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history’s biggest
  fraud.2
* Who was responsible? Neither kings, nor priests, nor merchants. The culprits
  were a handful of plant species, including wheat, rice and potatoes. These
  plants domesticated Homo sapiens, rather than vice versa.
* Ten thousand years ago wheat was just a wild grass, one of many, confined to a
  small range in the Middle East. Suddenly, within just a few short millennia,
  it was growing all over the world.
* In areas such as the Great Plains of North America, where not a single wheat
  stalk grew 10,000 years ago, you can today walk for hundreds upon hundreds of
  miles without encountering any other plant.
* Worldwide, wheat covers about 870,000 square miles of the globe’s surface,
  almost ten times the size of Britain. How did this grass turn from
  insignificant to ubiquitous?
* Moreover, the new agricultural tasks demanded so much time that people were
  forced to settle permanently next to their wheat fields. This completely
  changed their way of life. We did not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us.
* The early farmers were at least as violent as their forager ancestors, if not
  more so.
* Many anthropological and archaeological studies indicate that in simple
  agricultural societies with no political frameworks beyond village and tribe,
  human violence was responsible for about 15 per cent of deaths, including 25
  per cent of male deaths.
* If a species boasts many DNA copies, it is a success, and the species
  flourishes. From such a perspective, 1,000 copies are always better than a
  hundred copies. This is the essence of the Agricultural Revolution: the
  ability to keep more people alive under worse conditions.
* Homo sapiens reached the Middle East around 70,000 years ago. For the next
  50,000 years our ancestors flourished there without agriculture.
* In the years following 9500 BC, the descendants of the Natufians continued to
  gather and process cereals, but they also began to cultivate them in more and
  more elaborate ways. When gathering wild grains, they took care to lay aside
  part of the harvest to sow the fields next season. They discovered that they
  could achieve much better results by sowing the grains deep in the ground
  rather than haphazardly scattering them on the surface. So they began to hoe
  and plough.
* As more effort was directed towards cereal cultivation, there was less time to
  gather and hunt wild species. The foragers became farmers.
* No single step separated the woman gathering wild wheat from the woman farming
  domesticated wheat, so it’s hard to say exactly when the decisive transition
  to agriculture took place. But, by 8500 BC, the Middle East was peppered with
  permanent villages such as Jericho, whose inhabitants spent most of their time
  cultivating a few domesticated species.
* As people began living in disease-ridden settlements, as children fed more on
  cereals and less on mother’s milk, and as each child competed for his or her
  porridge with more and more siblings, child mortality soared. In most
  agricultural societies at least one out of every three children died before
  reaching twenty.5 Yet the increase in births still outpaced the increase in
  deaths; humans kept having larger numbers of children.
* The average person in Jericho of 8500 BC lived a harder life than the average
  person in Jericho of 9500 BC or 13,000 BC. But nobody realised what was
  happening. Every generation continued to live like the previous generation,
  making only small improvements here and there in the way things were done.
* Then why didn’t humans abandon farming when the plan backfired? Partly
  because it took generations for the small changes to accumulate and transform
  society and, by then, nobody remembered that they had ever lived differently.
* The pursuit of an easier life resulted in much hardship, and not for the last
  time. It happens to us today. How many young college graduates have taken
  demanding jobs in high-powered firms, vowing that they will work hard to earn
  money that will enable them to retire and pursue their real interests when
  they are thirty-five? But by the time they reach that age, they have large
  mortgages, children to school, houses in the suburbs that necessitate at least
  two cars per family, and a sense that life is not worth living without really
  good wine and expensive holidays abroad. What are they supposed to do, go back
  to digging up roots? No, they double their efforts and keep slaving away.
* One of history’s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities
  and to spawn new obligations.
* Once people get used to a certain luxury, they take it for granted. Then they
  begin to count on it. Finally they reach a point where they can’t live
  without it.
* Most people wrote and received no more than a handful of letters a month and
  seldom felt compelled to reply immediately. Today I receive dozens of emails
  each day, all from people who expect a prompt reply. We thought we were saving
  time; instead we revved up the treadmill of life to ten times its former speed
  and made our days more anxious and agitated.
* Humanity’s search for an easier life released immense forces of change that
  transformed the world in ways nobody envisioned or wanted.
* Yet as they studied Göbekli Tepe, they discovered an amazing fact. Stonehenge
  dates to 2500 BC, and was built by a developed agricultural society. The
  structures at Göbekli Tepe are dated to about 9500 BC, and all available
  evidence indicates that they were built by hunter-gatherers.
* In 1995 archaeologists began to excavate a site in south-east Turkey called
  Göbekli Tepe. In the oldest stratum they discovered no signs of a settlement,
  houses or daily activities. They did, however, find monumental pillared
  structures decorated with spectacular engravings. Each stone pillar weighed up
  to seven tons and reached a height of sixteen feet. In a nearby quarry they
  found a half-chiselled pillar weighing fifty tons.
* The capabilities of ancient foragers, and the complexity of their cultures,
  seem to be far more impressive than was previously suspected.
* The only way to build Göbekli Tepe was for thousands of foragers belonging to
  different bands and tribes to cooperate over an extended period of time. Only
  a sophisticated religious or ideological system could sustain such efforts.
* Recent discoveries indicate that at least one domesticated variant, einkorn
  wheat, originated in the Karaçadag Hills – less than twenty miles from
  Göbekli Tepe.6
* Domesticated chickens and cattle may well be an evolutionary success story,
  but they are also among the most miserable creatures that ever lived.
* The natural lifespan of wild chickens is about seven to twelve years, and of
  cattle about twenty to twenty-five years. In the wild, most chickens and
  cattle died long before that, but they still had a fair chance of living for a
  respectable number of years. In contrast, the vast majority of domesticated
  chickens and cattle are slaughtered at the age of between a few weeks and a
  few months, because this has always been the optimal slaughtering age from an
  economic perspective.
* Egg-laying hens, dairy cows and draught animals are sometimes allowed to live
  for many years. But the price is subjugation to a way of life completely alien
  to their urges and desires.
* In order for humans to turn bulls, horses, donkeys and camels into obedient
  draught animals, their natural instincts and social ties had to be broken,
  their aggression and sexuality contained, and their freedom of movement
  curtailed.
* Farmers developed techniques such as locking animals inside pens and cages,
  bridling them in harnesses and leashes, training them with whips and cattle
  prods, and mutilating them.
* The castrated and domesticated ox wasted away his life under the lash and in a
  narrow pen, labouring alone or in pairs in a way that suited neither its body
  nor its social and emotional needs. When an ox could no longer pull the
  plough, it was slaughtered.
* (Note the hunched position of the Egyptian farmer who, much like the ox, spent
  his life in hard labour oppressive to his body, his mind and his social
  relationships.)
* To ensure that the pigs can’t run away, farmers in northern New Guinea slice
  off a chunk of each pig’s nose.
* In another area of New Guinea, it has been customary to gouge out pigs’
  eyes, so that they cannot even see where they’re going.7
* The dairy industry has its own ways of forcing animals to do its will. Cows,
  goats and sheep produce milk only after giving birth to calves, kids and
  lambs, and only as long as the youngsters are suckling. To continue a supply
  of animal milk, a farmer needs to have calves, kids or lambs for suckling, but
  must prevent them from monopolising the milk. One common method throughout
  history was to simply slaughter the calves and kids shortly after birth, milk
  the mother for all she was worth, and then get her pregnant again.
* This is still a very widespread technique. In many modern dairy farms a milk
  cow usually lives for about five years before being slaughtered. During these
  five years she is almost constantly pregnant, and is fertilised within 60 to
  120 days after giving birth in order to preserve maximum milk production. Her
  calves are separated from her shortly after birth. The females are reared to
  become the next generation of dairy cows, whereas the males are handed over to
  the care of the meat industry.8
* Another method is to keep the calves and kids near their mothers, but prevent
  them by various stratagems from suckling too much milk. The simplest way to do
  that is to allow the kid or calf to start suckling, but drive it away once the
  milk starts flowing. This method usually encounters resistance from both kid
  and mother.
* Some shepherd tribes used to kill the offspring, eat its flesh, and then stuff
  the skin. The stuffed offspring was then presented to the mother so that its
  presence would encourage her milk production.
* The Nuer tribe in the Sudan went so far as to smear stuffed animals with their
  mother’s urine, to give the counterfeit calves a familiar, live scent.
* Another Nuer technique was to tie a ring of thorns around a calf’s mouth, so
  that it pricks the mother and causes her to resist suckling.9
* Tuareg camel breeders in the Sahara used to puncture or cut off parts of the
  nose and upper lip of young camels in order to make suckling painful, thereby
  discouraging them from consuming too much milk.10
* Shepherds and farmers throughout history showed affection for their animals
  and have taken great care of them, just as many slaveholders felt affection
  and concern for their slaves. It was no accident that kings and prophets
  styled themselves as shepherds and likened the way they and the gods cared for
  their people to a shepherd’s care for his flock.
* A modern calf in an industrial meat farm. Immediately after birth the calf is
  separated from its mother and locked inside a tiny cage not much bigger than
  the calf’s own body. There the calf spends its entire life – about four
  months on average. It never leaves its cage, nor is it allowed to play with
  other calves or even walk – all so that its muscles will not grow strong.
  Soft muscles mean a soft and juicy steak. The first time the calf has a chance
  to walk, stretch its muscles and touch other calves is on its way to the
  slaughterhouse.
* In evolutionary terms, cattle represent one of the most successful animal
  species ever to exist. At the same time, they are some of the most miserable
  animals on the planet.
* Yet from the viewpoint of the herd, rather than that of the shepherd, it’s
  hard to avoid the impression that for the vast majority of domesticated
  animals, the Agricultural Revolution was a terrible catastrophe. Their
  evolutionary ‘success’ is meaningless. A rare wild rhinoceros on the brink
  of extinction is probably more satisfied than a calf who spends its short life
  inside a tiny box, fattened to produce juicy steaks.
* The numerical success of the calf’s species is little consolation for the
  suffering the individual endures.
* Around 10,000 BC, before the transition to agriculture, earth was home to
  about 5–8 million nomadic foragers. By the first century AD, only 1–2
  million foragers remained (mainly in Australia, America and Africa), but their
  numbers were dwarfed by the world’s 250 million farmers.1
* Ancient hunter-gatherers usually lived in territories covering many dozens and
  even hundreds of square miles. ‘Home’ was the entire territory, with its
  hills, streams, woods and open sky. Peasants, on the other hand, spent most of
  their days working a small field or orchard, and their domestic lives centred
  on a cramped structure of wood, stone or mud, measuring no more than a few
  dozen feet – the house.
* This was a far-reaching revolution, whose impact was psychological as much as
  architectural. Henceforth, attachment to ‘my house’ and separation from
  the neighbours became the psychological hallmark of a much more self-centred
  creature.
* The earth’s surface measures about 200 million square miles, of which 60
  million is land. As late as AD 1400, the vast majority of farmers, along with
  their plants and animals, clustered together in an area of just 4.25 million
  square miles – 2 per cent of the planet’s surface.2 Everywhere else was
  too cold, too hot, too dry, too wet, or otherwise unsuited for cultivation.
* History is something that very few people have been doing while everyone else
  was ploughing fields and carrying water buckets.
* Stories about ancestral spirits and tribal totems were strong enough to enable
  500 people to trade seashells, celebrate the odd festival, and join forces to
  wipe out a Neanderthal band, but no more than that. Mythology, the ancient
  sociologist would have thought, could not possibly enable millions of
  strangers to cooperate on a daily basis. But that turned out to be wrong.
  Myths, it transpired, are stronger than anyone could have imagined.
* By 7000 BC the town of Çatalhöyük in Anatolia numbered between 5,000 and
  10,000 individuals. It may well have been the world’s biggest settlement at
  the time.
* Most human cooperation networks have been geared towards oppression and
  exploitation.
* All these cooperation networks – from the cities of ancient Mesopotamia to
  the Qin and Roman empires – were ‘imagined orders’. The social norms
  that sustained them were based neither on ingrained instincts nor on personal
  acquaintances, but rather on belief in shared myths.
* Now let’s examine two of the best-known myths of history: the Code of
  Hammurabi of c.1776 BC, which served as a cooperation manual for hundreds of
  thousands of ancient Babylonians; and the American Declaration of Independence
  of 1776 AD, which today still serves as a cooperation manual for hundreds of
  millions of modern Americans.
* In 1776 BC Babylon was the world’s biggest city. The Babylonian Empire was
  probably the world’s largest, with more than a million subjects. It ruled
  most of Mesopotamia, including the bulk of modern Iraq and parts of present-
  day Syria and Iran.
* The text begins by saying that the gods Anu, Enlil and Marduk – the leading
  deities of the Mesopotamian pantheon – appointed Hammurabi ‘to make
  justice prevail in the land, to abolish the wicked and the evil, to prevent
  the strong from oppressing the weak’.
* Hammurabi’s Code asserts that Babylonian social order is rooted in universal
  and eternal principles of justice, dictated by the gods. The principle of
  hierarchy is of paramount importance. According to the code, people are
  divided into two genders and three classes: superior people, commoners and
  slaves. Members of each gender and class have different values. The life of a
  female commoner is worth thirty silver shekels and that of a slave-woman
  twenty silver shekels, whereas the eye of a male commoner is worth sixty
  silver shekels.
* The code also establishes a strict hierarchy within families, according to
  which children are not independent persons, but rather the property of their
  parents. Hence, if one superior man kills the daughter of another superior
  man, the killer’s daughter is executed in punishment.
* The two texts present us with an obvious dilemma. Both the Code of Hammurabi
  and the American Declaration of Independence claim to outline universal and
  eternal principles of justice, but according to the Americans all people are
  equal, whereas according to the Babylonians people are decidedly unequal. The
  Americans would, of course, say that they are right, and that Hammurabi is
  wrong. Hammurabi, naturally, would retort that he is right, and that the
  Americans are wrong. In fact, they are both wrong. Hammurabi and the American
  Founding Fathers alike imagined a reality governed by universal and immutable
  principles of justice, such as equality or hierarchy. Yet the only place where
  such universal principles exist is in the fertile imagination of Sapiens, and
  in the myths they invent and tell one another. These principles have no
  objective validity.
* Let us try to translate the most famous line of the American Declaration of
  Independence into biological terms: We hold these truths to be self-evident,
  that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with
  certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the
  pursuit of happiness. According to the science of biology, people were not
  ‘created’. They have evolved. And they certainly did not evolve to be
  ‘equal’. The idea of equality is inextricably intertwined with the idea of
  creation. The Americans got the idea of equality from Christianity, which
  argues that every person has a divinely created soul, and that all souls are
  equal before God. However, if we do not believe in the Christian myths about
  God, creation and souls, what does it mean that all people are ‘equal’?
  Evolution is based on difference, not on equality. Every person carries a
  somewhat different genetic code, and is exposed from birth to different
  environmental influences. This leads to the development of different qualities
  that carry with them different chances of survival. ‘Created equal’ should
  therefore be translated into ‘evolved differently’.
* Just as people were never created, neither, according to the science of
  biology, is there a ‘Creator’ who ‘endows’ them with anything. There
  is only a blind evolutionary process, devoid of any purpose, leading to the
  birth of individuals. ‘Endowed by their creator’ should be translated
  simply into ‘born’.
* Equally, there are no such things as rights in biology. There are only organs,
  abilities and characteristics. Birds fly not because they have a right to fly,
  but because they have wings.
* And it’s not true that these organs, abilities and characteristics are
  ‘unalienable’. Many of them undergo constant mutations, and may well be
  completely lost over time. The ostrich is a bird that lost its ability to fly.
  So ‘unalienable rights’ should be translated into ‘mutable
  characteristics’.
* And what about ‘happiness’? So far biological research has failed to come
  up with a clear definition of happiness or a way to measure it objectively.
  Most biological studies acknowledge only the existence of pleasure, which is
  more easily defined and measured. So ‘life, liberty, and the pursuit of
  happiness’ should be translated into ‘life and the pursuit of pleasure’.
* So here is that line from the American Declaration of Independence translated
  into biological terms: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men
  evolved differently, that they are born with certain mutable characteristics,
  and that among these are life and the pursuit of pleasure.
* Imagined orders are not evil conspiracies or useless mirages. Rather, they are
  the only way large numbers of humans can cooperate effectively.
* If people realise that human rights exist only in the imagination, isn’t
  there a danger that our society will collapse? Voltaire said about God that
  ‘there is no God, but don’t tell that to my servant, lest he murder me at
  night’.
* Homo sapiens has no natural rights, just as spiders, hyenas and chimpanzees
  have no natural rights. But don’t tell that to our servants, lest they
  murder us at night.
* You also educate people thoroughly. From the moment they are born, you
  constantly remind them of the principles of the imagined order, which are
  incorporated into anything and everything. They are incorporated into fairy
  tales, dramas, paintings, songs, etiquette, political propaganda,
  architecture, recipes and fashions.
* Three main factors prevent people from realising that the order organising
  their lives exists only in their imagination:
* a. The imagined order is embedded in the material world.
* b. The imagined order shapes our desires. Most
* For instance, the most cherished desires of present-day Westerners are shaped
  by romantic, nationalist, capitalist and humanist myths that have been around
  for centuries.
* People today spend a great deal of money on holidays abroad because they are
  true believers in the myths of romantic consumerism.
* Romanticism tells us that in order to make the most of our human potential we
  must have as many different experiences as we can. We must open ourselves to a
  wide spectrum of emotions; we must sample various kinds of relationships; we
  must try different cuisines; we must learn to appreciate different styles of
  music. One of the best ways to do all that is to break free from our daily
  routine, leave behind our familiar setting, and go travelling in distant
  lands, where we can ‘experience’ the culture, the smells, the tastes and
  the norms of other people. We hear again and again the romantic myths about
  ‘how a new experience opened my eyes and changed my life’.
* Consumerism tells us that in order to be happy we must consume as many
  products and services as possible.
* If we feel that something is missing or not quite right, then we probably need
  to buy a product (a car, new clothes, organic food) or a service
  (housekeeping, relationship therapy, yoga classes). Every television
  commercial is another little legend about how consuming some product or
  service will make life better.
* Other animals that engage strangers in ritualized aggression do so largely by
  instinctpuppies
* Because the Sapiens social order is imagined, humans cannot preserve the
  critical information for running it simply by making copies of their DNA and
  passing these on to their progeny.
* But when particularly complex societies began to appear in the wake of the
  Agricultural Revolution, a completely new type of information became vital –
  numbers.
* (The Sumerians used a combination of base-6 and base-10 numeral systems. Their
  base-6 system bestowed on us several important legacies, such as the division
  of the day into twenty-four hours and of the circle into 360 degrees.)
* The earliest messages our ancestors have left us read, for example, ‘29,086
  measures barley 37 months Kushim.’ The most probable reading of this
  sentence is: ‘A total of 29,086 measures of barley were received over the
  course of 37 months. Signed, Kushim.’
* The Hebrew Bible, the Greek Iliad, the Hindu Mahabharata and the Buddhist
  Tipitika all began as oral works. For many generations they were transmitted
  orally and would have lived on even had writing never been invented.
* What set apart Sumer, as well as pharaonic Egypt, ancient China and the Inca
  Empire, is that these cultures developed good techniques of archiving,
  cataloguing and retrieving written records.
* This partial script was composed of ten signs, representing the numbers from 0
  to 9. Confusingly, these signs are known as Arabic numerals even though they
  were first invented by the Hindus (even more confusingly, modern Arabs use a
  set of digits that look quite different from Western ones). But the Arabs get
  the credit because when they invaded India they encountered the system,
  understood its usefulness, refined it, and spread it through the Middle East
  and then to Europe. When several other signs were later added to the Arab
  numerals (such as the signs for addition, subtraction and multiplication), the
  basis of modern mathematical notation came into being.
* With rare exceptions, human brains are simply incapable of thinking through
  concepts like relativity and quantum mechanics. Physicists nevertheless manage
  to do so, because they set aside the traditional human way of thinking, and
  learn to think anew with the help of external data-processing systems.
* how did humans organise themselves in mass-cooperation networks, when they
  lacked the biological instincts necessary to sustain such networks? The short
  answer is that humans created imagined orders and devised scripts. These two
  inventions filled the gaps left by our biological inheritance.
* The imagined orders sustaining these networks were neither neutral nor fair.
  They divided people into make-believe groups, arranged in a hierarchy. The
  upper levels enjoyed privileges and power, while the lower ones suffered from
  discrimination and oppression.
* Despite its proclamation of the equality of all men, the imagined order
  established by the Americans in 1776 also established a hierarchy. It created
  a hierarchy between men, who benefited from it, and women, whom it left
  disempowered. It created a hierarchy between whites, who enjoyed liberty, and
  blacks and American Indians, who were considered humans of a lesser type and
  therefore did not share in the equal rights of men. Many of those who signed
  the Declaration of Independence were slaveholders. They did not release their
  slaves upon signing the Declaration, nor did they consider themselves
  hypocrites. In their view, the rights of men had little to do with Negroes.
* The American order also consecrated the hierarchy between rich and poor. Most
  Americans at that time had little problem with the inequality caused by
  wealthy parents passing their money and businesses on to their children. In
  their view, equality meant simply that the same laws applied to rich and poor.
  It had nothing to do with unemployment benefits, integrated education or
  health insurance. Liberty, too, carried very different connotations than it
  does today.
* The American order thereby upheld the hierarchy of wealth, which some thought
  was mandated by God and others viewed as representing the immutable laws of
  nature. Nature, it was claimed, rewarded merit with wealth while penalising
  indolence.
* All the above-mentioned distinctions – between free persons and slaves,
  between whites and blacks, between rich and poor – are rooted in fictions.
* Yet it is an iron rule of history that every imagined hierarchy disavows its
  fictional origins and claims to be natural and inevitable.
* Modern Westerners are taught to scoff at the idea of racial hierarchy. They
  are shocked by laws prohibiting blacks to live in white neighbourhoods, or to
  study in white schools, or to be treated in white hospitals. But the hierarchy
  of rich and poor – which mandates that rich people live in separate and more
  luxurious neighbourhoods, study in separate and more prestigious schools, and
  receive medical treatment in separate and better-equipped facilities – seems
  perfectly sensible to many Americans and Europeans.
* Yet it’s a proven fact that most rich people are rich for the simple reason
  that they were born into a rich family, while most poor people will remain
  poor throughout their lives simply because they were born into a poor family.
* Unfortunately, complex human societies seem to require imagined hierarchies
  and unjust discrimination. Of course not all hierarchies are morally
  identical, and some societies suffered from more extreme types of
  discrimination than others, yet scholars know of no large society that has
  been able to dispense with discrimination altogether.
* Even if somebody is born with a particular talent, that talent will usually
  remain latent if it is not fostered, honed and exercised. Not all people get
  the same chance to cultivate and refine their abilities.
* The economic game was rigged by legal restrictions and unofficial glass
  ceilings.
* For instance, many scholars surmise that the Hindu caste system took shape
  when Indo-Aryan people invaded the Indian subcontinent about 3,000 years ago,
  subjugating the local population. The invaders established a stratified
  society, in which they – of course – occupied the leading positions
  (priests and warriors), leaving the natives to live as servants and slaves.
* Secondly, in Africa there already existed a well-developed slave trade
  (exporting slaves mainly to the Middle East), whereas in Europe slavery was
  very rare.
* Thirdly, and most importantly, American plantations in places such as
  Virginia, Haiti and Brazil were plagued by malaria and yellow fever, which had
  originated in Africa. Africans had acquired over the generations a partial
  genetic immunity to these diseases, whereas Europeans were totally defenceless
  and died in droves.
* Paradoxically, genetic superiority (in terms of immunity) translated into
  social inferiority: precisely because Africans were fitter in tropical
  climates than Europeans, they ended up as the slaves of European masters!
* By the mid-twentieth century, segregation in the former Confederate states was
  probably worse than in the late nineteenth century. Clennon King, a black
  student who applied to the University of Mississippi in 1958, was forcefully
  committed to a mental asylum. The presiding judge ruled that a black person
  must surely be insane to think that he could be admitted to the University of
  Mississippi.
* Race is very important to modern Americans but was relatively insignificant to
  medieval Muslims. Caste was a matter of life and death in medieval India,
  whereas in modern Europe it is practically non-existent. One hierarchy,
  however, has been of supreme importance in all known human societies: the
  hierarchy of gender. People everywhere have divided themselves into men and
  women. And almost everywhere men have got the better deal, at least since the
  Agricultural Revolution.
* More than 3,000 years later, when Communist China enacted the ‘one child’
  policy, many Chinese families continued to regard the birth of a girl as a
  misfortune. Parents would occasionally abandon or murder newborn baby girls in
  order to have another shot at getting a boy.
* In many societies women were simply the property of men, most often their
  fathers, husbands or brothers. Rape, in many legal systems, falls under
  property violation – in other words, the victim is not the woman who was
  raped but the male who owns her. This being the case, the legal remedy was the
  transfer of ownership – the rapist was required to pay a bride price to the
  woman’s father or brother, upon which she became the rapist’s property.
* The Bible decrees that ‘If a man meets a virgin who is not betrothed, and
  seizes her and lies with her, and they are found, then the man who lay with
  her shall give to the father of the young woman fifty shekels of silver, and
  she shall be his wife’ (Deuteronomy 22:28–9). The ancient Hebrews
  considered this a reasonable arrangement.
* Raping a woman who did not belong to any man was not considered a crime at
  all, just as picking up a lost coin on a busy street is not considered theft.
* For instance, in democratic Athens of the fifth century BC, an individual
  possessing a womb had no independent legal status and was forbidden to
  participate in popular assemblies or to be a judge.
* In fact, though, Mother Nature does not mind if men are sexually attracted to
  one another. It’s only human mothers and fathers steeped in particular
  cultures who make a scene if their son has a fling with the boy next door.
* A significant number of human cultures have viewed homosexual relations as not
  only legitimate but even socially constructive, ancient Greece being the most
  notable example. The Iliad does not mention that Thetis had any objection to
  her son Achilles’ relations with Patroclus. Queen Olympias of Macedon was
  one of the most temperamental and forceful women of the ancient world, and
  even had her own husband, King Philip, assassinated. Yet she didn’t have a
  fit when her son, Alexander the Great, brought his lover Hephaestion home for
  dinner.
* How can we distinguish what is biologically determined from what people merely
  try to justify through biological myths? A good rule of thumb is ‘Biology
  enables, Culture forbids.’ Biology is willing to tolerate a very wide
  spectrum of possibilities. It’s culture that obliges people to realise some
  possibilities while forbidding others.
* But from a biological perspective, nothing is unnatural. Whatever is possible
  is by definition also natural. A truly unnatural behaviour, one that goes
  against the laws of nature, simply cannot exist, so it would need no
  prohibition.
* In truth, our concepts ‘natural’ and ‘unnatural’ are taken not from
  biology, but from Christian theology. The theological meaning of ‘natural’
  is ‘in accordance with the intentions of the God who created nature’.
* Christian theologians argued that God created the human body, intending each
  limb and organ to serve a particular purpose. If we use our limbs and organs
  for the purpose envisioned by God, then it is a natural activity.
* But evolution has no purpose. Organs have not evolved with a purpose, and the
  way they are used is in constant flux. There is not a single organ in the
  human body that only does the job its prototype did when it first appeared
  hundreds of millions of years ago. Organs evolve to perform a particular
  function, but once they exist, they can be adapted for other usages as well.
  Mouths, for example, appeared because the earliest multicellular organisms
  needed a way to take nutrients into their bodies. We still use our mouths for
  that purpose, but we also use them to kiss, speak and, if we are Rambo, to
  pull the pins out of hand grenades.
* According to one theory, insect wings evolved millions of years ago from body
  protrusions on flightless bugs. Bugs with bumps had a larger surface area than
  those without bumps, and this enabled them to absorb more sunlight and thus
  stay warmer. In a slow evolutionary process, these solar heaters grew larger.
  The same structure that was good for maximum sunlight absorption – lots of
  surface area, little weight – also, by coincidence, gave the insects a bit
  of a lift when they skipped and jumped. Those with bigger protrusions could
  skip and jump farther. Some insects started using the things to glide, and
  from there it was a small step to wings that could actually propel the bug
  through the air.
* Chimpanzees, for example, use sex to cement political alliances, establish
  intimacy and defuse tensions.
* Eighteenth-century masculinity: an official portrait of King Louis XIV of
  France. Note the long wig, stockings, high-heeled shoes, dancer’s posture
  – and huge sword. In contemporary Europe, all these (except for the sword)
  would be considered marks of effeminacy. But in his time Louis was a European
  paragon of manhood and virility.
* To make things less confusing, scholars usually distinguish between ‘sex’,
  which is a biological category, and ‘gender’, a cultural category.
* Sex is divided between males and females, and the qualities of this division
  are objective and have remained constant throughout history. Gender is divided
  between men and women (and some cultures recognise other categories).
* Males must prove their masculinity constantly, throughout their lives, from
  cradle to grave, in an endless series of rites and performances. And a
  woman’s work is never done – she must continually convince herself and
  others that she is feminine enough.
* Throughout history, males have been willing to risk and even sacrifice their
  lives, just so that people will say ‘He’s a real man!’
* Gender is a race in which some of the runners compete only for the bronze
  medal.
* Since patriarchy is so universal, it cannot be the product of some vicious
  circle that was kick-started by a chance occurrence. It is particularly
  noteworthy that even before 1492, most societies in both America and Afro-Asia
  were patriarchal, even though they had been out of contact for thousands of
  years. If patriarchy in Afro-Asia resulted from some chance occurrence, why
  were the Aztecs and Incas patriarchal?
* There are two problems with this emphasis on muscle power. First, the
  statement that ‘men are stronger than women’ is true only on average, and
  only with regard to certain types of strength. Women are generally more
  resistant to hunger, disease and fatigue than men. There are also many women
  who can run faster and lift heavier weights than many men.
* Furthermore, and most problematically for this theory, women have, throughout
  history, been excluded mainly from jobs that require little physical effort
  (such as the priesthood, law and politics), while engaging in hard manual
  labour in the fields, in crafts and in the household.
* There are many species of animals, such as elephants and bonobo chimpanzees,
  in which the dynamics between dependent females and competitive males results
  in a matriarchal society.
* Bonobo and elephant societies are controlled by strong networks of cooperative
  females, while the self-centred and uncooperative males are pushed to the
  sidelines. Though bonobo females are weaker on average than the males, the
  females often gang up to beat males who overstep their limits.
* Sapiens are relatively weak animals, whose advantage rests in their ability to
  cooperate in large numbers.
* During the first half of the twentieth century, scholars taught that every
  culture was complete and harmonious, possessing an unchanging essence that
  defined it for all time. Each human group had its own world view and system of
  social, legal and political arrangements that ran as smoothly as the planets
  going around the sun. In this view, cultures left to their own devices did not
  change. They just kept going at the same pace and in the same direction. Only
  a force applied from outside could change them. Anthropologists, historians
  and politicians thus referred to ‘Samoan Culture’ or ‘Tasmanian
  Culture’ as if the same beliefs, norms and values had characterised Samoans
  and Tasmanians from time immemorial.
* Today, most scholars of culture have concluded that the opposite is true.
  Every culture has its typical beliefs, norms and values, but these are in
  constant flux. The culture may transform itself in response to changes in its
  environment or through interaction with neighbouring cultures. But cultures
  also undergo transitions due to their own internal dynamics. Even a completely
  isolated culture existing in an ecologically stable environment cannot avoid
  change.
* Ever since the French Revolution, people throughout the world have gradually
  come to see both equality and individual freedom as fundamental values. Yet
  the two values contradict each other. Equality can be ensured only by
  curtailing the freedoms of those who are better off. Guaranteeing that every
  individual will be free to do as he wishes inevitably short-changes equality.
* Democrats want a more equitable society, even if it means raising taxes to
  fund programmes to help the poor, elderly and infirm. But that infringes on
  the freedom of individuals to spend their money as they wish. Why should the
  government force me to buy health insurance if I prefer using the money to put
  my kids through college? Republicans, on the other hand, want to maximise
  individual freedom, even if it means that the income gap between rich and poor
  will grow wider and that many Americans will not be able to afford health
  care.
* If tensions, conflicts and irresolvable dilemmas are the spice of every
  culture, a human being who belongs to any particular culture must hold
  contradictory beliefs and be riven by incompatible values. It’s such an
  essential feature of any culture that it even has a name: cognitive
  dissonance. Cognitive dissonance is often considered a failure of the human
  psyche. In fact, it is a vital asset.
* Consider Tasmania, a medium-sized island south of Australia. It was cut off
  from the Australian mainland in about 10,000 BC as the end of the Ice Age
  caused the sea level to rise. A few thousand hunter-gatherers were left on the
  island, and had no contact with any other humans until the arrival of the
  Europeans in the nineteenth century. For 12,000 years, nobody else knew the
  Tasmanians were there, and they didn’t know that there was anyone else in
  the world. They had their wars, political struggles, social oscillations and
  cultural developments.
* We still talk a lot about ‘authentic’ cultures, but if by ‘authentic’
  we mean something that developed independently, and that consists of ancient
  local traditions free of external influences, then there are no authentic
  cultures left on earth. Over the last few centuries, all cultures were changed
  almost beyond recognition by a flood of global influences.
* In 1492 there were no horses in America.
* Library.} Homo sapiens evolved to think of people as divided into us and them.
* When the natives questioned Cortés as to why the Spaniards had such a passion
  for gold, the conquistador answered, ‘Because I and my companions suffer
  from a disease of the heart which can be cured only with gold.’
* Yet alongside the new currency, the victors minted another type of coin,
  called the millares, which carried a somewhat different message. These square
  coins made by the Christian conquerors were emblazoned with flowing Arabic
  script that declared: ‘There is no god except Allah, and Muhammad is
  Allah’s messenger.’ Even the Catholic bishops of Melgueil and Agde issued
  these faithful copies of popular Muslim coins, and God-fearing Christians
  happily used them.2
* There have been many types of money. The most familiar is the coin, which is a
  standardised piece of imprinted metal. Yet money existed long before the
  invention of coinage, and cultures have prospered using other things as
  currency, such as shells, cattle, skins, salt, grain, beads, cloth and
  promissory notes. Cowry shells were used as money for about 4,000 years all
  over Africa, South Asia, East Asia and Oceania. Taxes could still be paid in
  cowry shells in British Uganda in the early twentieth century.
* One Auschwitz survivor described the cigarette currency used in the camp:
  ‘We had our own currency, whose value no one questioned: the cigarette. The
  price of every article was stated in cigarettes . . . In “normal” times,
  that is, when the candidates to the gas chambers were coming in at a regular
  pace, a loaf of bread cost twelve cigarettes; a 10-ounce package of margarine,
  thirty; a watch, eighty to 200; a 0.25-gallon bottle of alcohol, 400
  cigarettes!’
* The sum total of money in the world is about $60 trillion, yet the sum total
  of coins and banknotes is less than $6 trillion. 7 More than 90 per cent of
  all money – more than $50 trillion appearing in our accounts – exists only
  on computer servers.
* Because money can convert, store and transport wealth easily and cheaply, it
  made a vital contribution to the appearance of complex commercial networks and
  dynamic markets.
* Take a dollar bill and look at it carefully. You will see that it is simply a
  colourful piece of paper with the signature of the US secretary of the
  treasury on one side, and the slogan ‘In God We Trust’ on the other. We
  accept the dollar in payment, because we trust in God and the US secretary of
  the treasury. The crucial role of trust explains why our financial systems are
  so tightly bound up with our political, social and ideological systems, why
  financial crises are often triggered by political developments, and why the
  stock market can rise or fall depending on the way traders feel on a
  particular morning.
* Almost all coins in use today are descendants of the Lydian coins.
* More importantly, the mark on the coin is the signature of some political
  authority that guarantees the coin’s value.
* The name ‘denarius’ became a generic name for coins. Muslim caliphs
  Arabicised this name and issued ‘dinars’. The dinar is still the official
  name of the currency in Jordan, Iraq, Serbia, Macedonia, Tunisia and several
  other countries.
* People continued to speak mutually incomprehensible languages, obey different
  rulers and worship distinct gods, but all believed in gold and silver and in
  gold and silver coins.
* For thousands of years, philosophers, thinkers and prophets have besmirched
  money and called it the root of all evil. Be that as it may, money is also the
  apogee of human tolerance. Money is more open-minded than language, state
  laws, cultural codes, religious beliefs and social habits. Money is the only
  trust system created by humans that can bridge almost any cultural gap, and
  that does not discriminate on the basis of religion, gender, race, age or
  sexual orientation.
* As money brings down the dams of community, religion and state, the world is
  in danger of becoming one big and rather heartless marketplace.
* Hence the economic history of humankind is a delicate dance. People rely on
  money to facilitate cooperation with strangers, but they’re afraid it will
  corrupt human values and intimate relations. With one hand people willingly
  destroy the communal dams that held at bay the movement of money and commerce
  for so long. Yet with the other hand they build new dams to protect society,
  religion and the environment from enslavement to market forces.
* An empire that cannot sustain a blow and remain standing is not really an
  empire.
