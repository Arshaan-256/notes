* 500 The Scientific Revolution. Humankind admits its ignorance and begins to
  acquire unprecedented power. Europeans begin to conquer America and the
  oceans. The entire planet becomes a single historical arena. The rise of
  capitalism.
* ABOUT 13.5 BILLION YEARS AGO, MATTER, energy, time and space came into being
  in what is known as the Big Bang. The story of these fundamental features of
  our universe is called physics.
* About 300,000 years after their appearance, matter and energy started to
  coalesce into complex structures, called atoms, which then combined into
  molecules. The story of atoms, molecules and their interactions is called
  chemistry.
* About 3.8 billion years ago, on a planet called Earth, certain molecules
  combined to form particularly large and intricate structures called organisms.
  The story of organisms is called biology.
* Three important revolutions shaped the course of history: the Cognitive
  Revolution kick-started history about 70,000 years ago. The Agricultural
  Revolution sped it up about 12,000 years ago. The Scientific Revolution, which
  got under way only 500 years ago, may well end history and start something
  completely different.
* There were humans long before there was history.
* On a hike in East Africa 2 million years ago, you might well have encountered
  a familiar cast of human characters: anxious mothers cuddling their babies and
  clutches of carefree children playing in the mud; temperamental youths chafing
  against the dictates of society and weary elders who just wanted to be left in
  peace; chest-thumping machos trying to impress the local beauty and wise old
  matriarchs who had already seen it all.
* These archaic humans loved, played, formed close friendships and competed for
  status and power – but so did chimpanzees, baboons and elephants. There was
  nothing special about humans.
* The most important thing to know about prehistoric humans is that they were
  insignificant animals with no more impact on their environment than gorillas,
  fireflies or jellyfish.
* Species that evolved from a common ancestor are bunched together under the
  heading ‘genus’ (plural genera). Lions, tigers, leopards and jaguars are
  different species within the genus Panthera. Biologists label organisms with a
  two-part Latin name, genus followed by species. Lions, for example, are called
  Panthera leo, the species leo of the genus Panthera. Presumably, everyone
  reading this book is a Homo sapiens – the species sapiens (wise) of the
  genus Homo (man).
* Genera in their turn are grouped into families, such as the cats (lions,
  cheetahs, house cats), the dogs (wolves, foxes, jackals) and the elephants
  (elephants, mammoths, mastodons).
* All cats, for example, from the smallest house kitten to the most ferocious
  lion, share a common feline ancestor who lived about 25 million years ago.
* Homo sapiens long preferred to view itself as set apart from animals, an
  orphan bereft of family, lacking siblings or cousins, and most importantly,
  without parents. But that’s just not the case. Like it or not, we are
  members of a large and particularly noisy family called the great apes.
* Our closest living relatives include chimpanzees, gorillas and orang-utans.
  The chimpanzees are the closest. Just 6 million years ago, a single female ape
  had two daughters. One became the ancestor of all chimpanzees, the other is
  our own grandmother.
* Humans first evolved in East Africa about 2.5 million years ago from an
  earlier genus of apes called Australopithecus, which means ‘Southern Ape’.
  About 2 million years ago, some of these archaic men and women left their
  homeland to journey through and settle vast areas of North Africa, Europe and
  Asia.
* Humans in Europe and western Asia evolved into Homo neanderthalensis (‘Man
  from the Neander Valley’), popularly referred to simply as
  ‘Neanderthals’.
* Neanderthals, bulkier and more muscular than us Sapiens, were well adapted to
  the cold climate of Ice Age western Eurasia.
* The more eastern regions of Asia were populated by Homo erectus, ‘Upright
  Man’, who survived there for close to 2 million years, making it the most
  durable human species ever.
* It is doubtful whether Homo sapiens will still be around a thousand years from
  now, so 2 million years is really out of our league.
* On the island of Java, in Indonesia, lived Homo soloensis, ‘Man from the
  Solo Valley’, who was suited to life in the tropics.
* On another Indonesian island – the small island of Flores – archaic humans
  underwent a process of dwarfing. Humans first reached Flores when the sea
  level was exceptionally low, and the island was easily accessible from the
  mainland. When the seas rose again, some people were trapped on the island,
  which was poor in resources. Big people, who need a lot of food, died first.
  Smaller fellows survived much better. Over the generations, the people of
  Flores became dwarves. This unique species, known by scientists as Homo
  floresiensis, reached a maximum height of only 3.5 feet and weighed no more
  than fifty-five pounds. They were nevertheless able to produce stone tools,
  and even managed occasionally to hunt down some of the island’s elephants
  – though, to be fair, the elephants were a dwarf species as well.
* In 2010 another lost sibling was rescued from oblivion, when scientists
  excavating the Denisova Cave in Siberia discovered a fossilised finger bone.
  Genetic analysis proved that the finger belonged to a previously unknown human
  species, which was named Homo denisova. Who knows how many lost relatives of
  ours are waiting to be discovered in other caves, on other islands, and in
  other climes.
* The cradle of humanity continued to nurture numerous new species, such as Homo
  rudolfensis, ‘Man from Lake Rudolf’, Homo ergaster, ‘Working Man’, and
  eventually our own species, which we’ve immodestly named Homo sapiens,
  ‘Wise Man’.
* It’s a common fallacy to envision these species as arranged in a straight
  line of descent, with Ergaster begetting Erectus, Erectus begetting the
  Neanderthals, and the Neanderthals evolving into us. This linear model gives
  the mistaken impression that at any particular moment only one type of human
  inhabited the earth, and that all earlier species were merely older models of
  ourselves. The truth is that from about 2 million years ago until around
  10,000 years ago, the world was home, at one and the same time, to several
  human species.
* The earth of a hundred millennia ago was walked by at least six different
  species of man.
* The earliest men and women, 2.5 million years ago, had brains of about 36
  cubic inches. Modern Sapiens sport a brain averaging 73–85 cubic inches.
  Neanderthal brains were even bigger.
* In Homo sapiens, the brain accounts for about 2–3 per cent of total body
  weight, but it consumes 25 per cent of the body’s energy when the body is at
  rest.
* By comparison, the brains of other apes require only 8 per cent of rest-time
  energy.
* The first evidence for tool production dates from about 2.5 million years ago,
  and the manufacture and use of tools are the criteria by which archaeologists
  recognise ancient humans.
* Humankind paid for its lofty vision and industrious hands with backaches and
  stiff necks.
* Women paid extra. An upright gait required narrower hips, constricting the
  birth canal – and this just when babies’ heads were getting bigger and
  bigger. Death in childbirth became a major hazard for human females. Women who
  gave birth earlier, when the infant’s brain and head were still relatively
  small and supple, fared better and lived to have more children. Natural
  selection consequently favoured earlier births. And, indeed, compared to other
  animals, humans are born prematurely, when many of their vital systems are
  still under-developed. A colt can trot shortly after birth; a kitten leaves
  its mother to forage on its own when it is just a few weeks old. Human babies
  are helpless, dependent for many years on their elders for sustenance,
  protection and education.
* We assume that a large brain, the use of tools, superior learning abilities
  and complex social structures are huge advantages. It seems self-evident that
  these have made humankind the most powerful animal on earth. But humans
  enjoyed all of these advantages for a full 2 million years during which they
  remained weak and marginal creatures. Thus humans who lived a million years
  ago, despite their big brains and sharp stone tools, dwelt in constant fear of
  predators, rarely hunted large game, and subsisted mainly by gathering plants,
  scooping up insects, stalking small animals, and eating the carrion left
  behind by other more powerful carnivores.
* One of the most common uses of early stone tools was to crack open bones in
  order to get to the marrow. Some researchers believe this was our original
  niche. Just as woodpeckers specialise in extracting insects from the trunks of
  trees, the first humans specialised in extracting marrow from bones. Why
  marrow? Well, suppose you observe a pride of lions take down and devour a
  giraffe. You wait patiently until they’re done. But it’s still not your
  turn because first the hyenas and jackals – and you don’t dare interfere
  with them – scavenge the leftovers. Only then would you and your band dare
  approach the carcass, look cautiously left and right – and dig into the
  edible tissue that remained.
* This is a key to understanding our history and psychology. Genus Homo’s
  position in the food chain was, until quite recently, solidly in the middle.
  For millions of years, humans hunted smaller creatures and gathered what they
  could, all the while being hunted by larger predators. It was only 400,000
  years ago that several species of man began to hunt large game on a regular
  basis, and only in the last 100,000 years – with the rise of Homo sapiens
  – that man jumped to the top of the food chain.
* That spectacular leap from the middle to the top had enormous consequences.
  Other animals at the top of the pyramid, such as lions and sharks, evolved
  into that position very gradually, over millions of years. This enabled the
  ecosystem to develop checks and balances that prevent lions and sharks from
  wreaking too much havoc. As lions became deadlier, so gazelles evolved to run
  faster, hyenas to cooperate better, and rhinoceroses to be more bad-tempered.
  In contrast, humankind ascended to the top so quickly that the ecosystem was
  not given time to adjust. Moreover, humans themselves failed to adjust. Most
  top predators of the planet are majestic creatures. Millions of years of
  dominion have filled them with self-confidence. Sapiens by contrast is more
  like a banana republic dictator. Having so recently been one of the underdogs
  of the savannah, we are full of fears and anxieties over our position, which
  makes us doubly cruel and dangerous. Many historical calamities, from deadly
  wars to ecological catastrophes, have resulted from this over-hasty jump.
* A significant step on the way to the top was the domestication of fire. Some
  human species may have made occasional use of fire as early as 800,000 years
  ago. By about 300,000 years ago, Homo erectus, Neanderthals and the
  forefathers of Homo sapiens were using fire on a daily basis.
* Not long afterwards, humans may even have started deliberately to torch their
  neighbourhoods. A carefully managed fire could turn impassable barren thickets
  into prime grasslands teeming with game. In addition, once the fire died down,
  Stone Age entrepreneurs could walk through the smoking remains and harvest
  charcoaled animals, nuts and tubers.
* Fire not only changed food’s chemistry, it changed its biology as well.
  Cooking killed germs and parasites that infested food. Humans also had a far
  easier time chewing and digesting old favourites such as fruits, nuts, insects
  and carrion if they were cooked. Whereas chimpanzees spend five hours a day
  chewing raw food, a single hour suffices for people eating cooked food.
* The advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less
  time to eating, and to make do with smaller teeth and shorter intestines.
* Some scholars believe there is a direct link between the advent of cooking,
  the shortening of the human intestinal track, and the growth of the human
  brain.
* Eagles, for example, identify thermal columns rising from the ground, spread
  their giant wings and allow the hot air to lift them upwards. Yet eagles
  cannot control the location of the columns, and their maximum carrying
  capacity is strictly proportional to their wingspan.
* Despite the benefits of fire, 150,000 years ago humans were still marginal
  creatures. They could now scare away lions, warm themselves during cold
  nights, and burn down the occasional forest. Yet counting all species
  together, there were still no more than perhaps a million humans living
  between the Indonesian archipelago and the Iberian peninsula, a mere blip on
  the ecological radar.
* Our own species, Homo sapiens, was already present on the world stage, but so
  far it was just minding its own business in a corner of Africa. We don’t
  know exactly where and when animals that can be classified as Homo sapiens
  first evolved from some earlier type of humans, but most scientists agree that
  by 150,000 years ago, East Africa was populated by Sapiens that looked just
  like us. If one of them turned up in a modern morgue, the local pathologist
  would notice nothing peculiar.
* Scientists also agree that about 70,000 years ago, Sapiens from East Africa
  spread into the Arabian peninsula, and from there they quickly overran the
  entire Eurasian landmass.
* When Homo sapiens landed in Arabia, most of Eurasia was already settled by
  other humans.
* What happened to them? There are two conflicting theories. The
  ‘Interbreeding Theory’ tells a story of attraction, sex and mingling. As
  the African immigrants spread around the world, they bred with other human
  populations, and people today are the outcome of this interbreeding.
* For example, when Sapiens reached the Middle East and Europe, they encountered
  the Neanderthals. These humans were more muscular than Sapiens, had larger
  brains, and were better adapted to cold climes. They used tools and fire, were
  good hunters, and apparently took care of their sick and infirm.
* (Archaeologists have discovered the bones of Neanderthals who lived for many
  years with severe physical handicaps, evidence that they were cared for by
  their relatives.)
* Neanderthals are often depicted in caricatures as the archetypical brutish and
  stupid ‘cave people’, but recent evidence has changed their image.
* According to the Interbreeding Theory, when Sapiens spread into Neanderthal
  lands, Sapiens bred with Neanderthals until the two populations merged. If
  this is the case, then today’s Eurasians are not pure Sapiens. They are a
  mixture of Sapiens and Neanderthals. Similarly, when Sapiens reached East
  Asia, they interbred with the local Erectus, so the Chinese and Koreans are a
  mixture of Sapiens and Erectus.
* The opposing view, called the ‘Replacement Theory’ tells a very different
  story – one of incompatibility, revulsion, and perhaps even genocide.
* According to this theory, Sapiens and other humans had different anatomies,
  and most likely different mating habits and even body odours. They would have
  had little sexual interest in one another. And even if a Neanderthal Romeo and
  a Sapiens Juliet fell in love, they could not produce fertile children,
  because the genetic gulf separating the two populations was already
  unbridgeable. The two populations remained completely distinct, and when the
  Neanderthals died out, or were killed off, their genes died with them.
  According to this view, Sapiens replaced all the previous human populations
  without merging with them. If that is the case, the lineages of all
  contemporary humans can be traced back, exclusively, to East Africa, 70,000
  years ago.
* If the Replacement Theory is correct, all living humans have roughly the same
  genetic baggage, and racial distinctions among them are negligible.
* But if the Interbreeding Theory is right, there might well be genetic
  differences between Africans, Europeans and Asians that go back hundreds of
  thousands of years.
* In recent decades the Replacement Theory has been the common wisdom in the
  field. It had firmer archaeological backing, and was more politically correct
  (scientists had no desire to open up the Pandora’s box of racism by claiming
  significant genetic diversity among modern human populations).
* But that ended in 2010, when the results of a four-year effort to map the
  Neanderthal genome were published. Geneticists were able to collect enough
  intact Neanderthal DNA from fossils to make a broad comparison between it and
  the DNA of contemporary humans. The results stunned the scientific community.
  It turned out that 1–4 per cent of the unique human DNA of modern
  populations in the Middle East and Europe is Neanderthal DNA. That’s not a
  huge amount, but it’s significant.
* A second shock came several months later, when DNA extracted from the
  fossilised finger from Denisova was mapped. The results proved that up to 6
  per cent of the unique human DNA of modern Melanesians and Aboriginal
  Australians is Denisovan DNA.
* Since Neanderthals and Denisovans contributed only a small amount of DNA to
  our present-day genome, it is impossible to speak of a ‘merger’ between
  Sapiens and other human species. Although differences between them were not
  large enough to completely prevent fertile intercourse, they were sufficient
  to make such contacts very rare.
* It seems that about 50,000 years ago, Sapiens, Neanderthals and Denisovans
  were at that borderline point. They were almost, but not quite, entirely
  separate species.
* It is unsettling – and perhaps thrilling – to think that we Sapiens could
  at one time have sex with an animal from a different species, and produce
  children together.
* But if the Neanderthals, Denisovans and other human species didn’t merge
  with Sapiens, why did they vanish? One possibility is that Homo sapiens drove
  them to extinction.
* Imagine a Sapiens band reaching a Balkan valley where Neanderthals had lived
  for hundreds of thousands of years. The newcomers began to hunt the deer and
  gather the nuts and berries that were the Neanderthals’ traditional staples.
  Sapiens were more proficient hunters and gatherers – thanks to better
  technology and superior social skills – so they multiplied and spread. The
  less resourceful Neanderthals found it increasingly difficult to feed
  themselves. Their population dwindled and they slowly died out, except perhaps
  for one or two members who joined their Sapiens neighbours.
* Another possibility is that competition for resources flared up into violence
  and genocide. Tolerance is not a Sapiens trademark. In modern times, a small
  difference in skin colour, dialect or religion has been enough to prompt one
  group of Sapiens to set about exterminating another group. Would
* It may well be that when Sapiens encountered Neanderthals, the result was the
  first and most significant ethnic-cleansing campaign in history.
* Imagine how things might have turned out had the Neanderthals or Denisovans
  survived alongside Homo sapiens. What kind of cultures, societies and
  political structures would have emerged in a world where several different
  human species coexisted? How, for example, would religious faiths have
  unfolded? Would the book of Genesis have declared that Neanderthals descend
  from Adam and Eve, would Jesus have died for the sins of the Denisovans, and
  would the Qur’an have reserved seats in heaven for all righteous humans,
  whatever their species? Would Neanderthals have been able to serve in the
  Roman legions, or in the sprawling bureaucracy of imperial China? Would the
  American Declaration of Independence hold as a self-evident truth that all
  members of the genus Homo are created equal? Would Karl Marx have urged
  workers of all species to unite?
* When Charles Darwin indicated that Homo sapiens was just another kind of
  animal, people were outraged. Even today many refuse to believe it. Had the
  Neanderthals survived, would we still imagine ourselves to be a creature
  apart? Perhaps this is exactly why our ancestors wiped out the Neanderthals.
  They were too familiar to ignore, but too different to tolerate.
* Whether Sapiens are to blame or not, no sooner had they arrived at a new
  location than the native population became extinct.
* The last remains of Homo soloensis are dated to about 50,000 years ago. Homo
  denisova disappeared shortly thereafter. Neanderthals made their exit roughly
  30,000 years ago. The last dwarf-like humans vanished from Flores Island about
  12,000 years ago.
* They also left behind us, Homo sapiens, the last human species.
* in the first recorded encounter between Sapiens and Neanderthals, the
  Neanderthals won. About 100,000 years ago, some Sapiens groups migrated north
  to the Levant, which was Neanderthal territory, but failed to secure a firm
  footing. It might have been due to nasty natives, an inclement climate, or
  unfamiliar local parasites. Whatever the reason, the Sapiens eventually
  retreated, leaving the Neanderthals as masters of the Middle East.
* This poor record of achievement has led scholars to speculate that the
  internal structure of the brains of these Sapiens was probably different from
  ours. They looked like us, but their cognitive abilities – learning,
  remembering, communicating – were far more limited. Teaching such an ancient
  Sapiens English, persuading him of the truth of Christian dogma, or getting
  him to understand the theory of evolution would probably have been hopeless
  undertakings. Conversely, we would have had a very hard time learning his
  language and understanding his way of thinking.
* beginning about 70,000 years ago, Homo sapiens started doing very special
  things. Around that date Sapiens bands left Africa for a second time. This
  time they drove the Neanderthals and all other human species not only from the
  Middle East, but from the face of the earth.
* About 45,000 years ago, they somehow crossed the open sea and landed in
  Australia – a continent hitherto untouched by humans. The period from about
  70,000 years ago to about 30,000 years ago witnessed the invention of boats,
  oil lamps, bows and arrows and needles (essential for sewing warm clothing).
  The first objects that can reliably be called art date from this era (see the
  Stadel lion-man in this chapter), as does the first clear evidence for
  religion, commerce and social stratification.
* If we were to come across the artists of the Stadel Cave, we could learn their
  language and they ours. We’d be able to explain to them everything we know
  – from the adventures of Alice in Wonderland to the paradoxes of quantum
  physics – and they could teach us how their people view the world.
* The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between 70,000 and
  30,000 years ago, constitutes the Cognitive Revolution.
* What caused it? We’re not sure. The most commonly believed theory argues
  that accidental genetic mutations changed the inner wiring of the brains of
  Sapiens, enabling them to think in unprecedented ways and to communicate using
  an altogether new type of language. We might call it the Tree of Knowledge
  mutation.
* Why did it occur in Sapiens DNA rather than in that of Neanderthals? It was a
  matter of pure chance, as far as we can tell.
* Many animals, including all ape and monkey species, have vocal languages. For
  example, green monkeys use calls of various kinds to communicate. Zoologists
  have identified one call that means, ‘Careful! An eagle!’ A slightly
  different call warns, ‘Careful! A lion!’ When researchers played a
  recording of the first call to a group of monkeys, the monkeys stopped what
  they were doing and looked upwards in fear.
* When the same group heard a recording of the second call, the lion warning,
  they quickly scrambled up a tree.
* A parrot can say anything Albert Einstein could say, as well as mimicking the
  sounds of phones ringing, doors slamming and sirens wailing. Whatever
  advantage Einstein had over a parrot, it wasn’t vocal. What, then, is so
  special about our language? The most common answer is that our language is
  amazingly supple. We can connect a limited number of sounds and signs to
  produce an infinite number of sentences, each with a distinct meaning.
* A second theory agrees that our unique language evolved as a means of sharing
  information about the world. But the most important information that needed to
  be conveyed was about humans, not about lions and bison.
* Our language evolved as a way of gossiping. According to this theory Homo
  sapiens is primarily a social animal. Social cooperation is our key for
  survival and reproduction.
* It is not enough for individual men and women to know the whereabouts of lions
  and bison. It’s much more important for them to know who in their band hates
  whom, who is sleeping with whom, who is honest, and who is a cheat.
* The amount of information that one must obtain and store in order to track the
  ever-changing relationships of even a few dozen individuals is staggering. (In
  a band of fifty individuals, there are 1,225 one-on-one relationships, and
  countless more complex social combinations.)
* All apes show a keen interest in such social information, but they have
  trouble gossiping effectively. Neanderthals and archaic Homo sapiens probably
  also had a hard time talking behind each other’s backs – a much maligned
  ability which is in fact essential for cooperation in large numbers.
* The new linguistic skills that modern Sapiens acquired about seventy millennia
  ago enabled them to gossip for hours on end. Reliable information about who
  could be trusted meant that small bands could expand into larger bands, and
  Sapiens could develop tighter and more sophisticated types of cooperation.1
* The gossip theory might sound like a joke, but numerous studies support it.
  Even today the vast majority of human communication – whether in the form of
  emails, phone calls or newspaper columns – is gossip. It comes so naturally
  to us that it seems as if our language evolved for this very purpose.
* Most likely, both the gossip theory and the there-is-a-lion-near-the-river
  theory are valid.
* Yet the truly unique feature of our language is not its ability to transmit
  information about men and lions. Rather, it’s the ability to transmit
  information about things that do not exist at all. As far as we know, only
  Sapiens can talk about entire kinds of entities that they have never seen,
  touched or smelled.
* Legends, myths, gods and religions appeared for the first time with the
  Cognitive Revolution. Many animals and human species could previously say,
  ‘Careful! A lion!’ Thanks to the Cognitive Revolution, Homo sapiens
  acquired the ability to say, ‘The lion is the guardian spirit of our
  tribe.’ This ability to speak about fictions is the most unique feature of
  Sapiens language.
* You could never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him
  limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven.
* Sapiens can cooperate in extremely flexible ways with countless numbers of
  strangers. That’s why Sapiens rule the world, whereas ants eat our leftovers
  and chimps are locked up in zoos and research laboratories.
* When two males are contesting the alpha position, they usually do so by
  forming extensive coalitions of supporters, both male and female, from within
  the group. Ties between coalition members are based on intimate daily contact
  – hugging, touching, kissing, grooming and mutual favours. Just as human
  politicians on election campaigns go around shaking hands and kissing babies,
  so aspirants to the top position in a chimpanzee group spend much time
  hugging, back-slapping and kissing baby chimps.
* The alpha male usually wins his position not because he is physically
  stronger, but because he leads a large and stable coalition.
* Researchers have documented prolonged warfare between groups, and even one
  case of ‘genocidal’ activity in which one troop systematically slaughtered
  most members of a neighbouring band.2
* In the wake of the Cognitive Revolution, gossip helped Homo sapiens to form
  larger and more stable bands.
* But even gossip has its limits. Sociological research has shown that the
  maximum ‘natural’ size of a group bonded by gossip is about 150
  individuals. Most people can neither intimately know, nor gossip effectively
  about, more than 150 human beings.
* Even today, a critical threshold in human organisations falls somewhere around
  this magic number. Below this threshold, communities, businesses, social
  networks and military units can maintain themselves based mainly on intimate
  acquaintance and rumour-mongering. There is no need for formal ranks, titles
  and law books to keep order.3
* The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers
  can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths.
* Any large-scale human cooperation – whether a modern state, a medieval
  church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe – is rooted in common myths that
  exist only in people’s collective imagination.
* There are no gods in the universe, no nations, no money, no human rights, no
  laws, and no justice outside the common imagination of human beings.
* Two lawyers who have never met can nevertheless combine efforts to defend a
  complete stranger because they both believe in the existence of laws, justice,
  human rights – and the money paid out in fees.
* People easily understand that ‘primitives’ cement their social order by
  believing in ghosts and spirits, and gathering each full moon to dance
  together around the campfire. What we fail to appreciate is that our modern
  institutions function on exactly the same basis.
* Modern business-people and lawyers are, in fact, powerful sorcerers. The
  principal difference between them and tribal shamans is that modern lawyers
  tell far stranger tales.
* In the US, the technical term for a limited liability company is a
  ‘corporation’, which is ironic, because the term derives from ‘corpus’
  (‘body’ in Latin) – the one thing these corporations lack.
* How exactly did Armand Peugeot, the man, create Peugeot, the company? In much
  the same way that priests and sorcerers have created gods and demons
  throughout history, and in which thousands of French curés were still
  creating Christ’s body every Sunday in the parish churches. It all revolved
  around telling stories, and convincing people to believe them.
* how does one convince millions of people to believe particular stories about
  gods, or nations, or limited liability companies? Yet when it succeeds, it
  gives Sapiens immense power, because it enables millions of strangers to
  cooperate and work towards common goals.
* Just try to imagine how difficult it would have been to create states, or
  churches, or legal systems if we could speak only about things that really
  exist, such as rivers, trees and lions.
* Green monkeys and chimpanzees can lie. A green monkey, for example, has been
  observed calling ‘Careful! A lion!’ when there was no lion around. This
  alarm conveniently frightened away a fellow monkey who had just found a
  banana, leaving the liar all alone to steal the prize for itself.
* Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens have thus been living in a dual
  reality. On the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and lions;
  and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and corporations.
  As time went by, the imagined reality became ever more powerful, so that today
  the very survival of rivers, trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined
  entities such as the United States and Google.
* Under the right circumstances myths can change rapidly. In 1789 the French
  population switched almost overnight from believing in the myth of the divine
  right of kings to believing in the myth of the sovereignty of the people.
* Animal behaviour is also influenced by environmental factors and individual
  quirks. Nevertheless, in a given environment, animals of the same species will
  tend to behave in a similar way. Significant changes in social behaviour
  cannot occur, in general, without genetic mutations.
* For example, common chimpanzees have a genetic tendency to live in
  hierarchical groups headed by an alpha male. Members of a closely related
  chimpanzee species, bonobos, usually live in more egalitarian groups dominated
  by female alliances. Female common chimpanzees cannot take lessons from their
  bonobo relatives and stage a feminist revolution. Male chimps cannot gather in
  a constitutional assembly to abolish the office of alpha male and declare that
  from here on out all chimps are to be treated as equals.
* Such dramatic changes in behaviour would occur only if something changed in
  the chimpanzees’ DNA.
* As far as we can tell, changes in social patterns, the invention of new
  technologies and the settlement of alien habitats resulted from genetic
  mutations and environmental pressures more than from cultural initiatives.
* This is why it took humans hundreds of thousands of years to make these steps.
* As long as Homo erectus did not undergo further genetic alterations, its stone
  tools remained roughly the same – for close to 2 million years!
* In contrast, ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens have been able to
  change their behaviour quickly, transmitting new behaviours to future
  generations without any need of genetic or environmental change.
* In other words, while the behaviour patterns of archaic humans remained fixed
  for tens of thousands of years, Sapiens could transform their social
  structures, the nature of their interpersonal relations, their economic
  activities and a host of other behaviours within a decade or two.
* Consider a resident of Berlin, born in 1900 and living to the ripe age of one
  hundred. She spent her childhood in the Hohenzollern Empire of Wilhelm II; her
  adult years in the Weimar Republic, the Nazi Third Reich and Communist East
  Germany; and she died a citizen of a democratic and reunified Germany. She had
  managed to be a part of five very different sociopolitical systems, though her
  DNA remained exactly the same.
* This was the key to Sapiens’ success. In a one-on-one brawl, a Neanderthal
  would probably have beaten a Sapiens. But in a conflict of hundreds,
  Neanderthals wouldn’t stand a chance. Neanderthals could share information
  about the whereabouts of lions, but they probably could not tell – and
  revise – stories about tribal spirits. Without an ability to compose
  fiction, Neanderthals were unable to cooperate effectively in large numbers,
  nor could they adapt their social behaviour to rapidly changing challenges.
* Sapiens bands that lived on the island of New Ireland, north of New Guinea,
  used a volcanic glass called obsidian to manufacture particularly strong and
  sharp tools. New Ireland, however, has no natural deposits of obsidian.
  Laboratory tests revealed that the obsidian they used was brought from
  deposits on New Britain, an island 250 miles away. Some of the inhabitants of
  these islands must have been skilled navigators who traded from island to
  island over long distances.5
* We may presume that Neanderthals were not pleased to see their traditional
  hunting grounds turned into Sapiens-controlled slaughterhouses.
* The immense diversity of imagined realities that Sapiens invented, and the
  resulting diversity of behaviour patterns, are the main components of what we
  call ‘cultures’. Once cultures appeared, they never ceased to change and
  develop, and these unstoppable alterations are what we call ‘history’.
* We are still animals, and our physical, emotional and cognitive abilities are
  still shaped by our DNA. Our societies are built from the same building blocks
  as Neanderthal or chimpanzee societies, and the more we examine these building
  blocks – sensations, emotions, family ties – the less difference we find
  between us and other apes.
* Physiologically, there has been no significant improvement in our tool-making
  capacity over the last 30,000 years. Albert Einstein was far less dexterous
  with his hands than was an ancient hunter-gatherer. However, our capacity to
  cooperate with large numbers of strangers has improved dramatically.
* As far as we know, the people who carved the Stadel lion-man some 30,000 years
  ago had the same physical, emotional and intellectual abilities we have.
* The flourishing field of evolutionary psychology argues that many of our
  present-day social and psychological characteristics were shaped during this
  long pre-agricultural era. Even today, scholars in this field claim, our
  brains and minds are adapted to a life of hunting and gathering. Our eating
  habits, our conflicts and our sexuality are all the result of the way our
  hunter-gatherer minds interact with our current post-industrial environment,
  with its mega-cities, aeroplanes, telephones and computers.
* The instinct to gorge on high-calorie food was hard-wired into our genes.
  Today we may be living in high-rise apartments with over-stuffed
  refrigerators, but our DNA still thinks we are in the savannah. That’s what
  makes some of us spoon down an entire tub of Ben & Jerry’s when we find one
  in the freezer and wash it down with a jumbo Coke.
* There are even a number of present-day human cultures in which collective
  fatherhood is practised, as for example among the Barí Indians. According to
  the beliefs of such societies, a child is not born from the sperm of a single
  man, but from the accumulation of sperm in a woman’s womb.
* A good mother will make a point of having sex with several different men,
  especially when she is pregnant, so that her child will enjoy the qualities
  (and paternal care) not merely of the best hunter, but also of the best
  storyteller, the strongest warrior and the most considerate lover.
* If this sounds silly, bear in mind that before the development of modern
  embryological studies, people had no solid evidence that babies are always
  sired by a single father rather than by many.
* Artefacts made of more perishable materials – such as wood, bamboo or
  leather – survive only under unique conditions. The common impression that
  pre-agricultural humans lived in an age of stone is a misconception based on
  this archaeological bias. The Stone Age should more accurately be called the
  Wood Age, because most of the tools used by ancient hunter-gatherers were made
  of wood.
* One good example is the huge variety the first European settlers found among
  the Aborigine peoples of Australia. Just before the British conquest, between
  300,000 and 700,000 hunter-gatherers lived on the continent in 200–600
  tribes, each of which was further divided into several bands.2 Each tribe had
  its own language, religion, norms and customs.
* For example, there’s every reason to believe that a forager band that lived
  30,000 years ago on the spot where Oxford University now stands would have
  spoken a different language from one living where Cambridge is now situated.
* Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, there hasn’t been a single natural way
  of life for Sapiens. There are only cultural choices, from among a bewildering
  palette of possibilities.
* Today, the society called New Zealand is composed of 4.5 million Sapiens and
  50 million sheep.
* There was just one exception to this general rule: the dog. The dog was the
  first animal domesticated by Homo sapiens, and this occurred before the
  Agricultural Revolution. Experts disagree about the exact date, but we have
  incontrovertible evidence of domesticated dogs from about 15,000 years ago.
  They may have joined the human pack thousands of years earlier.
* It seems safe to say that the vast majority of people lived in small bands
  numbering several dozen or at most several hundred individuals, and that all
  these individuals were humans. It is important to note this last point,
  because it is far from obvious. Most members of agricultural and industrial
  societies are domesticated animals.
* Simultaneously, dogs learned to manipulate people for their own needs. A
  15,000-year bond has yielded a much deeper understanding and affection between
  humans and dogs than between humans and any other animal.4 In some cases dead
  dogs were even buried ceremoniously, much like humans.
* The Sapiens population was thinly spread over vast territories. Before the
  Agricultural Revolution, the human population of the entire planet was smaller
  than that of today’s Cairo.
* If a forager band split once every forty years and its splinter group migrated
  to a new territory sixty miles to the east, the distance from East Africa to
  China would have been covered in about 10,000 years.
* Most importantly, alongside seas and rivers rich in seafood and waterfowl,
  humans set up permanent fishing villages – the first permanent settlements
  in history, long predating the Agricultural Revolution. Fishing villages might
  have appeared on the coasts of Indonesian islands as early as 45,000 years
  ago. These may have been the base from which Homo sapiens launched its first
  transoceanic enterprise: the invasion of Australia.
* Notwithstanding the popular image of ‘man the hunter’, gathering was
  Sapiens’ main activity, and it provided most of their calories, as well as
  raw materials such as flint, wood and bamboo.
* You could survive and pass your unremarkable genes to the next generation by
  working as a water carrier or an assembly-line worker.
* When agriculture and industry came along people could increasingly rely on the
  skills of others for survival, and new ‘niches for imbeciles’ were opened
  up.
* The hunter-gatherer way of life differed significantly from region to region
  and from season to season, but on the whole foragers seem to have enjoyed a
  more comfortable and rewarding lifestyle than most of the peasants, shepherds,
  labourers and office clerks who followed in their footsteps.
* While people in today’s affluent societies work an average of forty to
  forty-five hours a week, and people in the developing world work sixty and
  even eighty hours a week, hunter-gatherers living today in the most
  inhospitable of habitats – such as the Kalahari Desert – work on average
  for just thirty-five to forty-five hours a week.
* Today, a Chinese factory hand leaves home around seven in the morning, makes
  her way through polluted streets to a sweatshop, and there operates the same
  machine, in the same way, day in, day out, for ten long and mind-numbing
  hours, returning home around seven in the evening in order to wash dishes and
  do the laundry. Thirty thousand years ago, a Chinese forager might leave camp
  with her companions at, say, eight in the morning. They’d roam the nearby
  forests and meadows, gathering mushrooms, digging up edible roots, catching
  frogs and occasionally running away from tigers. By early afternoon, they were
  back at the camp to make lunch. That left them plenty of time to gossip, tell
  stories, play with the children and just hang out. Of course the tigers
  sometimes caught them, or a snake bit them, but on the other hand they
  didn’t have to deal with automobile accidents and industrial pollution.
* Evidence from fossilised skeletons indicates that ancient foragers were less
  likely to suffer from starvation or malnutrition, and were generally taller
  and healthier than their peasant descendants.
* Average life expectancy was apparently just thirty to forty years, but this
  was due largely to the high incidence of child mortality. Children who made it
  through the perilous first years had a good chance of reaching the age of
  sixty, and some even made it to their eighties.
* Most of the infectious diseases that have plagued agricultural and industrial
  societies (such as smallpox, measles and tuberculosis) originated in
  domesticated animals and were transferred to humans only after the
  Agricultural Revolution.
* When a valued band member died, the Aché customarily killed a little girl and
  buried the two together.
* When an old Aché woman became a burden to the rest of the band, one of the
  younger men would sneak behind her and kill her with an axe-blow to the head.
* An Aché man told the inquisitive anthropologists stories of his prime years
  in the jungle. ‘I customarily killed old women. I used to kill my aunts . .
  . The women were afraid of me . . . Now, here with the whites, I have become
  weak.’
* Babies born without hair, who were considered underdeveloped, were killed
  immediately.
* One woman recalled that her first baby girl was killed because the men in the
  band did not want another girl.
* On another occasion a man killed a small boy because he was ‘in a bad mood
  and the child was crying’. Another child was buried alive because ‘it was
  funny-looking and the other children laughed at it’. 7
* Anthropologists who lived with them for years report that violence between
  adults was very rare. Both women and men were free to change partners at will.
  They smiled and laughed constantly, had no leadership hierarchy, and generally
  shunned domineering people. They were extremely generous with their few
  possessions, and were not obsessed with success or wealth. The things they
  valued most in life were good social interactions and high-quality
  friendships.8
* It should also be noted that the Aché were hunted and killed without mercy by
  Paraguayan farmers.
* Just as there is no barrier between humans and other beings, neither is there
  a strict hierarchy. Non-human entities do not exist merely to provide for the
  needs of man. Nor are they all-powerful gods who run the world as they wish.
  The world does not revolve around humans or around any other particular group
  of beings.
* The generic rubric ‘theists’ covers Jewish rabbis from eighteenth-century
  Poland, witch-burning Puritans from seventeenth-century Massachusetts, Aztec
  priests from fifteenth-century Mexico, Sufi mystics from twelfth-century Iran,
  tenth-century Viking warriors, second-century Roman legionnaires, and first-
  century Chinese bureaucrats.
* Each of these viewed the others’ beliefs and practices as weird and
  heretical.
* the Sungir children are among the best pieces of evidence that 30,000 years
  ago Sapiens could invent sociopolitical codes that went far beyond the
  dictates of our DNA and the behaviour patterns of other human and animal
  species.
* during pre-industrial warfare more than 90 per cent of war dead were killed by
  starvation, cold and disease rather than by
* weapons.
* In Portugal, a survey was made of 400 skeletons from the period immediately
  predating the Agricultural Revolution. Only two skeletons showed clear marks
  of violence. A similar survey of 400 skeletons from the same period in Israel
  discovered a single crack in a single skull that could be attributed to human
  violence. A third survey of 400 skeletons from various pre-agricultural sites
  in the Danube Valley found evidence of violence on eighteen skeletons.
  Eighteen out of 400 may not sound like a lot, but it’s actually a very high
  percentage. If all eighteen indeed died violently, it means that about 4.5 per
  cent of deaths in the ancient Danube Valley were caused by human violence.
  Today, the global average is only 1.5 per cent, taking war and crime together.
* During the twentieth century, only 5 per cent of human deaths resulted from
  human violence – and this in a century that saw the bloodiest wars and most
  massive genocides in history.
* The depressing findings from the Danube Valley are supported by a string of
  equally depressing findings from other areas. At Jabl Sahaba in Sudan, a
  12,000-year-old cemetery containing fifty-nine skeletons was discovered.
  Arrowheads and spear points were found embedded in or lying near the bones of
  twenty-four skeletons, 40 per cent of the find. The skeleton of one woman
  revealed twelve injuries.
* In Ofnet Cave in Bavaria, archaeologists discovered the remains of thirty-
  eight foragers, mainly women and children, who had been thrown into two burial
  pits. Half the skeletons, including those of children and babies, bore clear
  signs of damage by human weapons such as clubs and knives. The few skeletons
  belonging to mature males bore the worst marks of violence. In all
  probability, an entire forager band was massacred at Ofnet.
* The foragers may have had their all-conquering Napoleons, who ruled empires
  half the size of Luxembourg; gifted Beethovens who lacked symphony orchestras
  but brought people to tears with the sound of their bamboo flutes; and
  charismatic prophets who revealed the words of a local oak tree rather than
  those of a universal creator god.
* Trekkers visiting the Siberian tundra, the deserts of central Australia and
  the Amazonian rainforest believe that they have entered pristine landscapes,
  virtually untouched by human hands. But that’s an illusion. The foragers
  were there before us and they brought about dramatic changes even in the
  densest jungles and the most desolate wildernesses.
* The wandering bands of storytelling Sapiens were the most important and most
  destructive force the animal kingdom had ever produced.
* PRIOR TO THE COGNITIVE REVOLUTION, humans of all species lived exclusively on
  the Afro-Asian landmass.
* The most reasonable theory suggests that, about 45,000 years ago, the Sapiens
  living in the Indonesian archipelago (a group of islands separated from Asia
  and from each other by only narrow straits) developed the first seafaring
  societies. They learned how to build and manoeuvre ocean-going vessels and
  became long-distance fishermen, traders and explorers.
* The Sapiens in Indonesia, descendants of apes who lived on the African
  savannah, became Pacific seafarers without growing flippers and without having
  to wait for their noses to migrate to the top of their heads as whales did.
  Instead, they built boats and learned how to steer them. And these skills
  enabled them to reach and settle Australia.
* rising sea levels have buried the ancient Indonesian shoreline under 300 feet
  of ocean).
* The journey of the first humans to Australia is one of the most important
  events in history, at least as important as Columbus’ journey to America or
  the Apollo II expedition to the moon. It was the first time any human had
  managed to leave the Afro-Asian ecological system – indeed, the first time
  any large terrestrial mammal had managed to cross from Afro-Asia to Australia.
* The moment the first hunter-gatherer set foot on an Australian beach was the
  moment that Homo sapiens climbed to the top rung in the food chain on a
  particular landmass and thereafter became the deadliest species in the annals
  of planet Earth.
* Within a few thousand years, virtually all of these giants vanished. Of the
  twenty-four Australian animal species weighing 100 pounds or more, twenty-
  three became extinct.2 A large number of smaller species also disappeared.
  Food chains throughout the entire Australian ecosystem were broken and
  rearranged. It was the most important transformation of the Australian
  ecosystem for millions of years. Was it all the fault of Homo sapiens?
* In particular, our planet has experienced numerous cycles of cooling and
  warming. During the last million years, there has been an ice age on average
  every 100,000 years. The last one ran from about 75,000 to 15,000 years ago.
* when climate change causes mass extinctions, sea creatures are usually hit as
  hard as land dwellers.
* Human involvement can easily explain why the wave of extinction obliterated
  the terrestrial megafauna of Australia while sparing that of the nearby
  oceans. Despite its burgeoning navigational abilities, Homo sapiens was still
  overwhelmingly a terrestrial menace.
* mass extinctions akin to the archetypal Australian decimation occurred again
  and again in the ensuing millennia – whenever people settled another part of
  the Outer World.
* The Maoris, New Zealand’s first Sapiens colonisers, reached the islands
  about 800 years ago. Within a couple of centuries, the majority of the local
  megafauna was extinct, along with 60 per cent of all bird species.
* the historical record makes Homo sapiens look like an ecological serial
  killer.
* Large animals – the primary victims of the Australian extinction – breed
  slowly. Pregnancy is long, offspring per pregnancy are few, and there are long
  breaks between pregnancies. Consequently, if humans cut down even one
  diprotodon every few months, it would be enough to cause diprotodon deaths to
  outnumber births. Within a few thousand years the last, lonesome diprotodon
  would pass away, and with her the entire species.4
* Various human species had been prowling and evolving in Afro-Asia for 2
  million years. They slowly honed their hunting skills, and began going after
  large animals around 400,000 years ago.
* But there are certainly good reasons to believe that if Homo sapiens had never
  gone Down Under, it would still be home to marsupial lions, diprotodons and
  giant kangaroos.
* The extinction of the Australian megafauna was probably the first significant
  mark Homo sapiens left on our planet.
* Homo sapiens was the first and only human species to reach the western
  hemisphere landmass, arriving about 16,000 years ago, that is in or around
  14,000 BC.
* The first Americans arrived on foot, which they could do because, at the time,
  sea levels were low enough that a land bridge connected north-eastern Siberia
  with north-western Alaska.
* The human blitzkrieg across America testifies to the incomparable ingenuity
  and the unsurpassed adaptability of Homo sapiens. No other animal had ever
  moved into such a huge variety of radically different habitats so quickly,
  everywhere using virtually the same genes.6
* American fauna 14,000 years ago was far richer than it is today. When the
  first Americans marched south from Alaska into the plains of Canada and the
  western United States, they encountered mammoths and mastodons, rodents the
  size of bears, herds of horses and camels, oversized lions and dozens of large
  species the likes of which are completely unknown today, among them fearsome
  sabre-tooth cats and giant ground sloths that weighed up to eight tons and
  reached a height of twenty feet.
* But no longer. Within 2,000 years of the Sapiens arrival, most of these unique
  species were gone. According to current estimates, within that short interval,
  North America lost thirty-four out of its forty-seven genera of large mammals.
  South America lost fifty out of sixty.
* At the time of the Cognitive Revolution, the planet was home to about 200
  genera of large terrestrial mammals weighing over 100 pounds. At the time of
  the Agricultural Revolution, only about a hundred remained.
* Homo sapiens drove to extinction about half of the planet’s big beasts long
  before humans invented the wheel, writing, or iron tools.
* The tragedy opens with a scene showing a rich and varied population of large
  animals, without any trace of humans. In scene two, Sapiens appear, evidenced
  by a human bone, a spear point, or perhaps a potsherd. Scene three quickly
  follows, in which men and women occupy centre stage and most large animals,
  along with many smaller ones, are gone.
* The elephant birds and the giant lemurs, along with most of the other large
  animals of Madagascar, suddenly vanished about 1,500 years ago – precisely
  when the first humans set foot on the island.
* Archaeologists have discovered on even the tiniest islands evidence of the
  existence of birds, insects and snails that lived there for countless
  generations, only to vanish when the first human farmers arrived.
* None but a few extremely remote islands escaped man’s notice until the
  modern age, and these islands kept their fauna intact. The Galapagos Islands,
  to give one famous example, remained uninhabited by humans until the
  nineteenth century, thus preserving their unique menagerie, including their
  giant tortoises, which, like the ancient diprotodons, show no fear of humans.
* Don’t believe tree-huggers who claim that our ancestors lived in harmony
  with nature. Long before the Industrial Revolution, Homo sapiens held the
  record among all organisms for driving the most plant and animal species to
  their extinctions. We have the dubious distinction of being the deadliest
  species in the annals of biology.
* If we knew how many species we’ve already eradicated, we might be more
  motivated to protect those that still survive.
* If things continue at the present pace, it is likely that whales, sharks, tuna
  and dolphins will follow the diprotodons, ground sloths and mammoths to
  oblivion. Among all the world’s large creatures, the only survivors of the
  human flood will be humans themselves, and the farmyard animals that serve as
  galley slaves in Noah’s Ark.
* The transition to agriculture began around 9500–8500 BC in the hill country
  of south-eastern Turkey, western Iran, and the Levant.
* Wheat and goats were domesticated by approximately 9000 BC; peas and lentils
  around 8000 BC; olive trees by 5000 BC; horses by 4000 BC; and grapevines in
  3500 BC.
* Some animals and plants, such as camels and cashew nuts, were domesticated
  even later, but by 3500 BC the main wave of domestication was over. Even
  today, with all our advanced technologies, more than 90 per cent of the
  calories that feed humanity come from the handful of plants that our ancestors
  domesticated between 9500 and 3500 BC – wheat, rice, maize (called
  ‘corn’ in the US), potatoes, millet and barley.
* No noteworthy plant or animal has been domesticated in the last 2,000 years.
* Today, scholars agree that agriculture sprang up in other parts of the world
  not by the action of Middle Eastern farmers exporting their revolution but
  entirely independently.
* The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the
  disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet
  or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered
  elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a
  worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history’s biggest
  fraud.2
* Who was responsible? Neither kings, nor priests, nor merchants. The culprits
  were a handful of plant species, including wheat, rice and potatoes. These
  plants domesticated Homo sapiens, rather than vice versa.
* Ten thousand years ago wheat was just a wild grass, one of many, confined to a
  small range in the Middle East. Suddenly, within just a few short millennia,
  it was growing all over the world.
* In areas such as the Great Plains of North America, where not a single wheat
  stalk grew 10,000 years ago, you can today walk for hundreds upon hundreds of
  miles without encountering any other plant.
* Worldwide, wheat covers about 870,000 square miles of the globe’s surface,
  almost ten times the size of Britain. How did this grass turn from
  insignificant to ubiquitous?
* Moreover, the new agricultural tasks demanded so much time that people were
  forced to settle permanently next to their wheat fields. This completely
  changed their way of life. We did not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us.
* The early farmers were at least as violent as their forager ancestors, if not
  more so.
* Many anthropological and archaeological studies indicate that in simple
  agricultural societies with no political frameworks beyond village and tribe,
  human violence was responsible for about 15 per cent of deaths, including 25
  per cent of male deaths.
* If a species boasts many DNA copies, it is a success, and the species
  flourishes. From such a perspective, 1,000 copies are always better than a
  hundred copies. This is the essence of the Agricultural Revolution: the
  ability to keep more people alive under worse conditions.
* Homo sapiens reached the Middle East around 70,000 years ago. For the next
  50,000 years our ancestors flourished there without agriculture.
* In the years following 9500 BC, the descendants of the Natufians continued to
  gather and process cereals, but they also began to cultivate them in more and
  more elaborate ways. When gathering wild grains, they took care to lay aside
  part of the harvest to sow the fields next season. They discovered that they
  could achieve much better results by sowing the grains deep in the ground
  rather than haphazardly scattering them on the surface. So they began to hoe
  and plough.
* As more effort was directed towards cereal cultivation, there was less time to
  gather and hunt wild species. The foragers became farmers.
* No single step separated the woman gathering wild wheat from the woman farming
  domesticated wheat, so it’s hard to say exactly when the decisive transition
  to agriculture took place. But, by 8500 BC, the Middle East was peppered with
  permanent villages such as Jericho, whose inhabitants spent most of their time
  cultivating a few domesticated species.
* As people began living in disease-ridden settlements, as children fed more on
  cereals and less on mother’s milk, and as each child competed for his or her
  porridge with more and more siblings, child mortality soared. In most
  agricultural societies at least one out of every three children died before
  reaching twenty.5 Yet the increase in births still outpaced the increase in
  deaths; humans kept having larger numbers of children.
* The average person in Jericho of 8500 BC lived a harder life than the average
  person in Jericho of 9500 BC or 13,000 BC. But nobody realised what was
  happening. Every generation continued to live like the previous generation,
  making only small improvements here and there in the way things were done.
* Then why didn’t humans abandon farming when the plan backfired? Partly
  because it took generations for the small changes to accumulate and transform
  society and, by then, nobody remembered that they had ever lived differently.
* The pursuit of an easier life resulted in much hardship, and not for the last
  time. It happens to us today. How many young college graduates have taken
  demanding jobs in high-powered firms, vowing that they will work hard to earn
  money that will enable them to retire and pursue their real interests when
  they are thirty-five? But by the time they reach that age, they have large
  mortgages, children to school, houses in the suburbs that necessitate at least
  two cars per family, and a sense that life is not worth living without really
  good wine and expensive holidays abroad. What are they supposed to do, go back
  to digging up roots? No, they double their efforts and keep slaving away.
* One of history’s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities
  and to spawn new obligations.
* Once people get used to a certain luxury, they take it for granted. Then they
  begin to count on it. Finally they reach a point where they can’t live
  without it.
* Most people wrote and received no more than a handful of letters a month and
  seldom felt compelled to reply immediately. Today I receive dozens of emails
  each day, all from people who expect a prompt reply. We thought we were saving
  time; instead we revved up the treadmill of life to ten times its former speed
  and made our days more anxious and agitated.
* Humanity’s search for an easier life released immense forces of change that
  transformed the world in ways nobody envisioned or wanted.
* Yet as they studied Göbekli Tepe, they discovered an amazing fact. Stonehenge
  dates to 2500 BC, and was built by a developed agricultural society. The
  structures at Göbekli Tepe are dated to about 9500 BC, and all available
  evidence indicates that they were built by hunter-gatherers.
* In 1995 archaeologists began to excavate a site in south-east Turkey called
  Göbekli Tepe. In the oldest stratum they discovered no signs of a settlement,
  houses or daily activities. They did, however, find monumental pillared
  structures decorated with spectacular engravings. Each stone pillar weighed up
  to seven tons and reached a height of sixteen feet. In a nearby quarry they
  found a half-chiselled pillar weighing fifty tons.
* The capabilities of ancient foragers, and the complexity of their cultures,
  seem to be far more impressive than was previously suspected.
* The only way to build Göbekli Tepe was for thousands of foragers belonging to
  different bands and tribes to cooperate over an extended period of time. Only
  a sophisticated religious or ideological system could sustain such efforts.
* Recent discoveries indicate that at least one domesticated variant, einkorn
  wheat, originated in the Karaçadag Hills – less than twenty miles from
  Göbekli Tepe.6
* Domesticated chickens and cattle may well be an evolutionary success story,
  but they are also among the most miserable creatures that ever lived.
* The natural lifespan of wild chickens is about seven to twelve years, and of
  cattle about twenty to twenty-five years. In the wild, most chickens and
  cattle died long before that, but they still had a fair chance of living for a
  respectable number of years. In contrast, the vast majority of domesticated
  chickens and cattle are slaughtered at the age of between a few weeks and a
  few months, because this has always been the optimal slaughtering age from an
  economic perspective.
* Egg-laying hens, dairy cows and draught animals are sometimes allowed to live
  for many years. But the price is subjugation to a way of life completely alien
  to their urges and desires.
* In order for humans to turn bulls, horses, donkeys and camels into obedient
  draught animals, their natural instincts and social ties had to be broken,
  their aggression and sexuality contained, and their freedom of movement
  curtailed.
* Farmers developed techniques such as locking animals inside pens and cages,
  bridling them in harnesses and leashes, training them with whips and cattle
  prods, and mutilating them.
* The castrated and domesticated ox wasted away his life under the lash and in a
  narrow pen, labouring alone or in pairs in a way that suited neither its body
  nor its social and emotional needs. When an ox could no longer pull the
  plough, it was slaughtered.
* (Note the hunched position of the Egyptian farmer who, much like the ox, spent
  his life in hard labour oppressive to his body, his mind and his social
  relationships.)
* To ensure that the pigs can’t run away, farmers in northern New Guinea slice
  off a chunk of each pig’s nose.
* In another area of New Guinea, it has been customary to gouge out pigs’
  eyes, so that they cannot even see where they’re going.7
* The dairy industry has its own ways of forcing animals to do its will. Cows,
  goats and sheep produce milk only after giving birth to calves, kids and
  lambs, and only as long as the youngsters are suckling. To continue a supply
  of animal milk, a farmer needs to have calves, kids or lambs for suckling, but
  must prevent them from monopolising the milk. One common method throughout
  history was to simply slaughter the calves and kids shortly after birth, milk
  the mother for all she was worth, and then get her pregnant again.
* This is still a very widespread technique. In many modern dairy farms a milk
  cow usually lives for about five years before being slaughtered. During these
  five years she is almost constantly pregnant, and is fertilised within 60 to
  120 days after giving birth in order to preserve maximum milk production. Her
  calves are separated from her shortly after birth. The females are reared to
  become the next generation of dairy cows, whereas the males are handed over to
  the care of the meat industry.8
* Another method is to keep the calves and kids near their mothers, but prevent
  them by various stratagems from suckling too much milk. The simplest way to do
  that is to allow the kid or calf to start suckling, but drive it away once the
  milk starts flowing. This method usually encounters resistance from both kid
  and mother.
* Some shepherd tribes used to kill the offspring, eat its flesh, and then stuff
  the skin. The stuffed offspring was then presented to the mother so that its
  presence would encourage her milk production.
* The Nuer tribe in the Sudan went so far as to smear stuffed animals with their
  mother’s urine, to give the counterfeit calves a familiar, live scent.
* Another Nuer technique was to tie a ring of thorns around a calf’s mouth, so
  that it pricks the mother and causes her to resist suckling.9
* Tuareg camel breeders in the Sahara used to puncture or cut off parts of the
  nose and upper lip of young camels in order to make suckling painful, thereby
  discouraging them from consuming too much milk.10
* Shepherds and farmers throughout history showed affection for their animals
  and have taken great care of them, just as many slaveholders felt affection
  and concern for their slaves. It was no accident that kings and prophets
  styled themselves as shepherds and likened the way they and the gods cared for
  their people to a shepherd’s care for his flock.
* A modern calf in an industrial meat farm. Immediately after birth the calf is
  separated from its mother and locked inside a tiny cage not much bigger than
  the calf’s own body. There the calf spends its entire life – about four
  months on average. It never leaves its cage, nor is it allowed to play with
  other calves or even walk – all so that its muscles will not grow strong.
  Soft muscles mean a soft and juicy steak. The first time the calf has a chance
  to walk, stretch its muscles and touch other calves is on its way to the
  slaughterhouse.
* In evolutionary terms, cattle represent one of the most successful animal
  species ever to exist. At the same time, they are some of the most miserable
  animals on the planet.
* Yet from the viewpoint of the herd, rather than that of the shepherd, it’s
  hard to avoid the impression that for the vast majority of domesticated
  animals, the Agricultural Revolution was a terrible catastrophe. Their
  evolutionary ‘success’ is meaningless. A rare wild rhinoceros on the brink
  of extinction is probably more satisfied than a calf who spends its short life
  inside a tiny box, fattened to produce juicy steaks.
* The numerical success of the calf’s species is little consolation for the
  suffering the individual endures.
* Around 10,000 BC, before the transition to agriculture, earth was home to
  about 5–8 million nomadic foragers. By the first century AD, only 1–2
  million foragers remained (mainly in Australia, America and Africa), but their
  numbers were dwarfed by the world’s 250 million farmers.1
* Ancient hunter-gatherers usually lived in territories covering many dozens and
  even hundreds of square miles. ‘Home’ was the entire territory, with its
  hills, streams, woods and open sky. Peasants, on the other hand, spent most of
  their days working a small field or orchard, and their domestic lives centred
  on a cramped structure of wood, stone or mud, measuring no more than a few
  dozen feet – the house.
* This was a far-reaching revolution, whose impact was psychological as much as
  architectural. Henceforth, attachment to ‘my house’ and separation from
  the neighbours became the psychological hallmark of a much more self-centred
  creature.
* The earth’s surface measures about 200 million square miles, of which 60
  million is land. As late as AD 1400, the vast majority of farmers, along with
  their plants and animals, clustered together in an area of just 4.25 million
  square miles – 2 per cent of the planet’s surface.2 Everywhere else was
  too cold, too hot, too dry, too wet, or otherwise unsuited for cultivation.
* History is something that very few people have been doing while everyone else
  was ploughing fields and carrying water buckets.
* Stories about ancestral spirits and tribal totems were strong enough to enable
  500 people to trade seashells, celebrate the odd festival, and join forces to
  wipe out a Neanderthal band, but no more than that. Mythology, the ancient
  sociologist would have thought, could not possibly enable millions of
  strangers to cooperate on a daily basis. But that turned out to be wrong.
  Myths, it transpired, are stronger than anyone could have imagined.
* By 7000 BC the town of Çatalhöyük in Anatolia numbered between 5,000 and
  10,000 individuals. It may well have been the world’s biggest settlement at
  the time.
* Most human cooperation networks have been geared towards oppression and
  exploitation.
* All these cooperation networks – from the cities of ancient Mesopotamia to
  the Qin and Roman empires – were ‘imagined orders’. The social norms
  that sustained them were based neither on ingrained instincts nor on personal
  acquaintances, but rather on belief in shared myths.
* Now let’s examine two of the best-known myths of history: the Code of
  Hammurabi of c.1776 BC, which served as a cooperation manual for hundreds of
  thousands of ancient Babylonians; and the American Declaration of Independence
  of 1776 AD, which today still serves as a cooperation manual for hundreds of
  millions of modern Americans.
* In 1776 BC Babylon was the world’s biggest city. The Babylonian Empire was
  probably the world’s largest, with more than a million subjects. It ruled
  most of Mesopotamia, including the bulk of modern Iraq and parts of present-
  day Syria and Iran.
* The text begins by saying that the gods Anu, Enlil and Marduk – the leading
  deities of the Mesopotamian pantheon – appointed Hammurabi ‘to make
  justice prevail in the land, to abolish the wicked and the evil, to prevent
  the strong from oppressing the weak’.
* Hammurabi’s Code asserts that Babylonian social order is rooted in universal
  and eternal principles of justice, dictated by the gods. The principle of
  hierarchy is of paramount importance. According to the code, people are
  divided into two genders and three classes: superior people, commoners and
  slaves. Members of each gender and class have different values. The life of a
  female commoner is worth thirty silver shekels and that of a slave-woman
  twenty silver shekels, whereas the eye of a male commoner is worth sixty
  silver shekels.
* The code also establishes a strict hierarchy within families, according to
  which children are not independent persons, but rather the property of their
  parents. Hence, if one superior man kills the daughter of another superior
  man, the killer’s daughter is executed in punishment.
* The two texts present us with an obvious dilemma. Both the Code of Hammurabi
  and the American Declaration of Independence claim to outline universal and
  eternal principles of justice, but according to the Americans all people are
  equal, whereas according to the Babylonians people are decidedly unequal. The
  Americans would, of course, say that they are right, and that Hammurabi is
  wrong. Hammurabi, naturally, would retort that he is right, and that the
  Americans are wrong. In fact, they are both wrong. Hammurabi and the American
  Founding Fathers alike imagined a reality governed by universal and immutable
  principles of justice, such as equality or hierarchy. Yet the only place where
  such universal principles exist is in the fertile imagination of Sapiens, and
  in the myths they invent and tell one another. These principles have no
  objective validity.
* Let us try to translate the most famous line of the American Declaration of
  Independence into biological terms: We hold these truths to be self-evident,
  that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with
  certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the
  pursuit of happiness. According to the science of biology, people were not
  ‘created’. They have evolved. And they certainly did not evolve to be
  ‘equal’. The idea of equality is inextricably intertwined with the idea of
  creation. The Americans got the idea of equality from Christianity, which
  argues that every person has a divinely created soul, and that all souls are
  equal before God. However, if we do not believe in the Christian myths about
  God, creation and souls, what does it mean that all people are ‘equal’?
  Evolution is based on difference, not on equality. Every person carries a
  somewhat different genetic code, and is exposed from birth to different
  environmental influences. This leads to the development of different qualities
  that carry with them different chances of survival. ‘Created equal’ should
  therefore be translated into ‘evolved differently’.
* Just as people were never created, neither, according to the science of
  biology, is there a ‘Creator’ who ‘endows’ them with anything. There
  is only a blind evolutionary process, devoid of any purpose, leading to the
  birth of individuals. ‘Endowed by their creator’ should be translated
  simply into ‘born’.
* Equally, there are no such things as rights in biology. There are only organs,
  abilities and characteristics. Birds fly not because they have a right to fly,
  but because they have wings.
* And it’s not true that these organs, abilities and characteristics are
  ‘unalienable’. Many of them undergo constant mutations, and may well be
  completely lost over time. The ostrich is a bird that lost its ability to fly.
  So ‘unalienable rights’ should be translated into ‘mutable
  characteristics’.
* And what about ‘happiness’? So far biological research has failed to come
  up with a clear definition of happiness or a way to measure it objectively.
  Most biological studies acknowledge only the existence of pleasure, which is
  more easily defined and measured. So ‘life, liberty, and the pursuit of
  happiness’ should be translated into ‘life and the pursuit of pleasure’.
* So here is that line from the American Declaration of Independence translated
  into biological terms: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men
  evolved differently, that they are born with certain mutable characteristics,
  and that among these are life and the pursuit of pleasure.
* Imagined orders are not evil conspiracies or useless mirages. Rather, they are
  the only way large numbers of humans can cooperate effectively.
* If people realise that human rights exist only in the imagination, isn’t
  there a danger that our society will collapse? Voltaire said about God that
  ‘there is no God, but don’t tell that to my servant, lest he murder me at
  night’.
* Homo sapiens has no natural rights, just as spiders, hyenas and chimpanzees
  have no natural rights. But don’t tell that to our servants, lest they
  murder us at night.
* You also educate people thoroughly. From the moment they are born, you
  constantly remind them of the principles of the imagined order, which are
  incorporated into anything and everything. They are incorporated into fairy
  tales, dramas, paintings, songs, etiquette, political propaganda,
  architecture, recipes and fashions.
* Three main factors prevent people from realising that the order organising
  their lives exists only in their imagination:
* a. The imagined order is embedded in the material world.
* b. The imagined order shapes our desires. Most
* For instance, the most cherished desires of present-day Westerners are shaped
  by romantic, nationalist, capitalist and humanist myths that have been around
  for centuries.
* People today spend a great deal of money on holidays abroad because they are
  true believers in the myths of romantic consumerism.
* Romanticism tells us that in order to make the most of our human potential we
  must have as many different experiences as we can. We must open ourselves to a
  wide spectrum of emotions; we must sample various kinds of relationships; we
  must try different cuisines; we must learn to appreciate different styles of
  music. One of the best ways to do all that is to break free from our daily
  routine, leave behind our familiar setting, and go travelling in distant
  lands, where we can ‘experience’ the culture, the smells, the tastes and
  the norms of other people. We hear again and again the romantic myths about
  ‘how a new experience opened my eyes and changed my life’.
* Consumerism tells us that in order to be happy we must consume as many
  products and services as possible.
* If we feel that something is missing or not quite right, then we probably need
  to buy a product (a car, new clothes, organic food) or a service
  (housekeeping, relationship therapy, yoga classes). Every television
  commercial is another little legend about how consuming some product or
  service will make life better.
* Other animals that engage strangers in ritualized aggression do so largely by
  instinctpuppies
* Because the Sapiens social order is imagined, humans cannot preserve the
  critical information for running it simply by making copies of their DNA and
  passing these on to their progeny.
* But when particularly complex societies began to appear in the wake of the
  Agricultural Revolution, a completely new type of information became vital –
  numbers.
* (The Sumerians used a combination of base-6 and base-10 numeral systems. Their
  base-6 system bestowed on us several important legacies, such as the division
  of the day into twenty-four hours and of the circle into 360 degrees.)
* The earliest messages our ancestors have left us read, for example, ‘29,086
  measures barley 37 months Kushim.’ The most probable reading of this
  sentence is: ‘A total of 29,086 measures of barley were received over the
  course of 37 months. Signed, Kushim.’
* The Hebrew Bible, the Greek Iliad, the Hindu Mahabharata and the Buddhist
  Tipitika all began as oral works. For many generations they were transmitted
  orally and would have lived on even had writing never been invented.
* What set apart Sumer, as well as pharaonic Egypt, ancient China and the Inca
  Empire, is that these cultures developed good techniques of archiving,
  cataloguing and retrieving written records.
* This partial script was composed of ten signs, representing the numbers from 0
  to 9. Confusingly, these signs are known as Arabic numerals even though they
  were first invented by the Hindus (even more confusingly, modern Arabs use a
  set of digits that look quite different from Western ones). But the Arabs get
  the credit because when they invaded India they encountered the system,
  understood its usefulness, refined it, and spread it through the Middle East
  and then to Europe. When several other signs were later added to the Arab
  numerals (such as the signs for addition, subtraction and multiplication), the
  basis of modern mathematical notation came into being.
* With rare exceptions, human brains are simply incapable of thinking through
  concepts like relativity and quantum mechanics. Physicists nevertheless manage
  to do so, because they set aside the traditional human way of thinking, and
  learn to think anew with the help of external data-processing systems.
* how did humans organise themselves in mass-cooperation networks, when they
  lacked the biological instincts necessary to sustain such networks? The short
  answer is that humans created imagined orders and devised scripts. These two
  inventions filled the gaps left by our biological inheritance.
* The imagined orders sustaining these networks were neither neutral nor fair.
  They divided people into make-believe groups, arranged in a hierarchy. The
  upper levels enjoyed privileges and power, while the lower ones suffered from
  discrimination and oppression.
* Despite its proclamation of the equality of all men, the imagined order
  established by the Americans in 1776 also established a hierarchy. It created
  a hierarchy between men, who benefited from it, and women, whom it left
  disempowered. It created a hierarchy between whites, who enjoyed liberty, and
  blacks and American Indians, who were considered humans of a lesser type and
  therefore did not share in the equal rights of men. Many of those who signed
  the Declaration of Independence were slaveholders. They did not release their
  slaves upon signing the Declaration, nor did they consider themselves
  hypocrites. In their view, the rights of men had little to do with Negroes.
* The American order also consecrated the hierarchy between rich and poor. Most
  Americans at that time had little problem with the inequality caused by
  wealthy parents passing their money and businesses on to their children. In
  their view, equality meant simply that the same laws applied to rich and poor.
  It had nothing to do with unemployment benefits, integrated education or
  health insurance. Liberty, too, carried very different connotations than it
  does today.
* The American order thereby upheld the hierarchy of wealth, which some thought
  was mandated by God and others viewed as representing the immutable laws of
  nature. Nature, it was claimed, rewarded merit with wealth while penalising
  indolence.
* All the above-mentioned distinctions – between free persons and slaves,
  between whites and blacks, between rich and poor – are rooted in fictions.
* Yet it is an iron rule of history that every imagined hierarchy disavows its
  fictional origins and claims to be natural and inevitable.
* Modern Westerners are taught to scoff at the idea of racial hierarchy. They
  are shocked by laws prohibiting blacks to live in white neighbourhoods, or to
  study in white schools, or to be treated in white hospitals. But the hierarchy
  of rich and poor – which mandates that rich people live in separate and more
  luxurious neighbourhoods, study in separate and more prestigious schools, and
  receive medical treatment in separate and better-equipped facilities – seems
  perfectly sensible to many Americans and Europeans.
* Yet it’s a proven fact that most rich people are rich for the simple reason
  that they were born into a rich family, while most poor people will remain
  poor throughout their lives simply because they were born into a poor family.
* Unfortunately, complex human societies seem to require imagined hierarchies
  and unjust discrimination. Of course not all hierarchies are morally
  identical, and some societies suffered from more extreme types of
  discrimination than others, yet scholars know of no large society that has
  been able to dispense with discrimination altogether.
* Even if somebody is born with a particular talent, that talent will usually
  remain latent if it is not fostered, honed and exercised. Not all people get
  the same chance to cultivate and refine their abilities.
* The economic game was rigged by legal restrictions and unofficial glass
  ceilings.
* For instance, many scholars surmise that the Hindu caste system took shape
  when Indo-Aryan people invaded the Indian subcontinent about 3,000 years ago,
  subjugating the local population. The invaders established a stratified
  society, in which they – of course – occupied the leading positions
  (priests and warriors), leaving the natives to live as servants and slaves.
* Secondly, in Africa there already existed a well-developed slave trade
  (exporting slaves mainly to the Middle East), whereas in Europe slavery was
  very rare.
* Thirdly, and most importantly, American plantations in places such as
  Virginia, Haiti and Brazil were plagued by malaria and yellow fever, which had
  originated in Africa. Africans had acquired over the generations a partial
  genetic immunity to these diseases, whereas Europeans were totally defenceless
  and died in droves.
* Paradoxically, genetic superiority (in terms of immunity) translated into
  social inferiority: precisely because Africans were fitter in tropical
  climates than Europeans, they ended up as the slaves of European masters!
* By the mid-twentieth century, segregation in the former Confederate states was
  probably worse than in the late nineteenth century. Clennon King, a black
  student who applied to the University of Mississippi in 1958, was forcefully
  committed to a mental asylum. The presiding judge ruled that a black person
  must surely be insane to think that he could be admitted to the University of
  Mississippi.
* Race is very important to modern Americans but was relatively insignificant to
  medieval Muslims. Caste was a matter of life and death in medieval India,
  whereas in modern Europe it is practically non-existent. One hierarchy,
  however, has been of supreme importance in all known human societies: the
  hierarchy of gender. People everywhere have divided themselves into men and
  women. And almost everywhere men have got the better deal, at least since the
  Agricultural Revolution.
* More than 3,000 years later, when Communist China enacted the ‘one child’
  policy, many Chinese families continued to regard the birth of a girl as a
  misfortune. Parents would occasionally abandon or murder newborn baby girls in
  order to have another shot at getting a boy.
* In many societies women were simply the property of men, most often their
  fathers, husbands or brothers. Rape, in many legal systems, falls under
  property violation – in other words, the victim is not the woman who was
  raped but the male who owns her. This being the case, the legal remedy was the
  transfer of ownership – the rapist was required to pay a bride price to the
  woman’s father or brother, upon which she became the rapist’s property.
* The Bible decrees that ‘If a man meets a virgin who is not betrothed, and
  seizes her and lies with her, and they are found, then the man who lay with
  her shall give to the father of the young woman fifty shekels of silver, and
  she shall be his wife’ (Deuteronomy 22:28–9). The ancient Hebrews
  considered this a reasonable arrangement.
* Raping a woman who did not belong to any man was not considered a crime at
  all, just as picking up a lost coin on a busy street is not considered theft.
* For instance, in democratic Athens of the fifth century BC, an individual
  possessing a womb had no independent legal status and was forbidden to
  participate in popular assemblies or to be a judge.
* In fact, though, Mother Nature does not mind if men are sexually attracted to
  one another. It’s only human mothers and fathers steeped in particular
  cultures who make a scene if their son has a fling with the boy next door.
* A significant number of human cultures have viewed homosexual relations as not
  only legitimate but even socially constructive, ancient Greece being the most
  notable example. The Iliad does not mention that Thetis had any objection to
  her son Achilles’ relations with Patroclus. Queen Olympias of Macedon was
  one of the most temperamental and forceful women of the ancient world, and
  even had her own husband, King Philip, assassinated. Yet she didn’t have a
  fit when her son, Alexander the Great, brought his lover Hephaestion home for
  dinner.
* How can we distinguish what is biologically determined from what people merely
  try to justify through biological myths? A good rule of thumb is ‘Biology
  enables, Culture forbids.’ Biology is willing to tolerate a very wide
  spectrum of possibilities. It’s culture that obliges people to realise some
  possibilities while forbidding others.
* But from a biological perspective, nothing is unnatural. Whatever is possible
  is by definition also natural. A truly unnatural behaviour, one that goes
  against the laws of nature, simply cannot exist, so it would need no
  prohibition.
* In truth, our concepts ‘natural’ and ‘unnatural’ are taken not from
  biology, but from Christian theology. The theological meaning of ‘natural’
  is ‘in accordance with the intentions of the God who created nature’.
* Christian theologians argued that God created the human body, intending each
  limb and organ to serve a particular purpose. If we use our limbs and organs
  for the purpose envisioned by God, then it is a natural activity.
* But evolution has no purpose. Organs have not evolved with a purpose, and the
  way they are used is in constant flux. There is not a single organ in the
  human body that only does the job its prototype did when it first appeared
  hundreds of millions of years ago. Organs evolve to perform a particular
  function, but once they exist, they can be adapted for other usages as well.
  Mouths, for example, appeared because the earliest multicellular organisms
  needed a way to take nutrients into their bodies. We still use our mouths for
  that purpose, but we also use them to kiss, speak and, if we are Rambo, to
  pull the pins out of hand grenades.
* According to one theory, insect wings evolved millions of years ago from body
  protrusions on flightless bugs. Bugs with bumps had a larger surface area than
  those without bumps, and this enabled them to absorb more sunlight and thus
  stay warmer. In a slow evolutionary process, these solar heaters grew larger.
  The same structure that was good for maximum sunlight absorption – lots of
  surface area, little weight – also, by coincidence, gave the insects a bit
  of a lift when they skipped and jumped. Those with bigger protrusions could
  skip and jump farther. Some insects started using the things to glide, and
  from there it was a small step to wings that could actually propel the bug
  through the air.
* Chimpanzees, for example, use sex to cement political alliances, establish
  intimacy and defuse tensions.
* Eighteenth-century masculinity: an official portrait of King Louis XIV of
  France. Note the long wig, stockings, high-heeled shoes, dancer’s posture
  – and huge sword. In contemporary Europe, all these (except for the sword)
  would be considered marks of effeminacy. But in his time Louis was a European
  paragon of manhood and virility.
* To make things less confusing, scholars usually distinguish between ‘sex’,
  which is a biological category, and ‘gender’, a cultural category.
* Sex is divided between males and females, and the qualities of this division
  are objective and have remained constant throughout history. Gender is divided
  between men and women (and some cultures recognise other categories).
* Males must prove their masculinity constantly, throughout their lives, from
  cradle to grave, in an endless series of rites and performances. And a
  woman’s work is never done – she must continually convince herself and
  others that she is feminine enough.
* Throughout history, males have been willing to risk and even sacrifice their
  lives, just so that people will say ‘He’s a real man!’
* Gender is a race in which some of the runners compete only for the bronze
  medal.
* Since patriarchy is so universal, it cannot be the product of some vicious
  circle that was kick-started by a chance occurrence. It is particularly
  noteworthy that even before 1492, most societies in both America and Afro-Asia
  were patriarchal, even though they had been out of contact for thousands of
  years. If patriarchy in Afro-Asia resulted from some chance occurrence, why
  were the Aztecs and Incas patriarchal?
* There are two problems with this emphasis on muscle power. First, the
  statement that ‘men are stronger than women’ is true only on average, and
  only with regard to certain types of strength. Women are generally more
  resistant to hunger, disease and fatigue than men. There are also many women
  who can run faster and lift heavier weights than many men.
* Furthermore, and most problematically for this theory, women have, throughout
  history, been excluded mainly from jobs that require little physical effort
  (such as the priesthood, law and politics), while engaging in hard manual
  labour in the fields, in crafts and in the household.
* There are many species of animals, such as elephants and bonobo chimpanzees,
  in which the dynamics between dependent females and competitive males results
  in a matriarchal society.
* Bonobo and elephant societies are controlled by strong networks of cooperative
  females, while the self-centred and uncooperative males are pushed to the
  sidelines. Though bonobo females are weaker on average than the males, the
  females often gang up to beat males who overstep their limits.
* Sapiens are relatively weak animals, whose advantage rests in their ability to
  cooperate in large numbers.
* During the first half of the twentieth century, scholars taught that every
  culture was complete and harmonious, possessing an unchanging essence that
  defined it for all time. Each human group had its own world view and system of
  social, legal and political arrangements that ran as smoothly as the planets
  going around the sun. In this view, cultures left to their own devices did not
  change. They just kept going at the same pace and in the same direction. Only
  a force applied from outside could change them. Anthropologists, historians
  and politicians thus referred to ‘Samoan Culture’ or ‘Tasmanian
  Culture’ as if the same beliefs, norms and values had characterised Samoans
  and Tasmanians from time immemorial.
* Today, most scholars of culture have concluded that the opposite is true.
  Every culture has its typical beliefs, norms and values, but these are in
  constant flux. The culture may transform itself in response to changes in its
  environment or through interaction with neighbouring cultures. But cultures
  also undergo transitions due to their own internal dynamics. Even a completely
  isolated culture existing in an ecologically stable environment cannot avoid
  change.
* Ever since the French Revolution, people throughout the world have gradually
  come to see both equality and individual freedom as fundamental values. Yet
  the two values contradict each other. Equality can be ensured only by
  curtailing the freedoms of those who are better off. Guaranteeing that every
  individual will be free to do as he wishes inevitably short-changes equality.
* Democrats want a more equitable society, even if it means raising taxes to
  fund programmes to help the poor, elderly and infirm. But that infringes on
  the freedom of individuals to spend their money as they wish. Why should the
  government force me to buy health insurance if I prefer using the money to put
  my kids through college? Republicans, on the other hand, want to maximise
  individual freedom, even if it means that the income gap between rich and poor
  will grow wider and that many Americans will not be able to afford health
  care.
* If tensions, conflicts and irresolvable dilemmas are the spice of every
  culture, a human being who belongs to any particular culture must hold
  contradictory beliefs and be riven by incompatible values. It’s such an
  essential feature of any culture that it even has a name: cognitive
  dissonance. Cognitive dissonance is often considered a failure of the human
  psyche. In fact, it is a vital asset.
* Consider Tasmania, a medium-sized island south of Australia. It was cut off
  from the Australian mainland in about 10,000 BC as the end of the Ice Age
  caused the sea level to rise. A few thousand hunter-gatherers were left on the
  island, and had no contact with any other humans until the arrival of the
  Europeans in the nineteenth century. For 12,000 years, nobody else knew the
  Tasmanians were there, and they didn’t know that there was anyone else in
  the world. They had their wars, political struggles, social oscillations and
  cultural developments.
* We still talk a lot about ‘authentic’ cultures, but if by ‘authentic’
  we mean something that developed independently, and that consists of ancient
  local traditions free of external influences, then there are no authentic
  cultures left on earth. Over the last few centuries, all cultures were changed
  almost beyond recognition by a flood of global influences.
* In 1492 there were no horses in America.
* Library.} Homo sapiens evolved to think of people as divided into us and them.
* When the natives questioned Cortés as to why the Spaniards had such a passion
  for gold, the conquistador answered, ‘Because I and my companions suffer
  from a disease of the heart which can be cured only with gold.’
* Yet alongside the new currency, the victors minted another type of coin,
  called the millares, which carried a somewhat different message. These square
  coins made by the Christian conquerors were emblazoned with flowing Arabic
  script that declared: ‘There is no god except Allah, and Muhammad is
  Allah’s messenger.’ Even the Catholic bishops of Melgueil and Agde issued
  these faithful copies of popular Muslim coins, and God-fearing Christians
  happily used them.2
* There have been many types of money. The most familiar is the coin, which is a
  standardised piece of imprinted metal. Yet money existed long before the
  invention of coinage, and cultures have prospered using other things as
  currency, such as shells, cattle, skins, salt, grain, beads, cloth and
  promissory notes. Cowry shells were used as money for about 4,000 years all
  over Africa, South Asia, East Asia and Oceania. Taxes could still be paid in
  cowry shells in British Uganda in the early twentieth century.
* One Auschwitz survivor described the cigarette currency used in the camp:
  ‘We had our own currency, whose value no one questioned: the cigarette. The
  price of every article was stated in cigarettes . . . In “normal” times,
  that is, when the candidates to the gas chambers were coming in at a regular
  pace, a loaf of bread cost twelve cigarettes; a 10-ounce package of margarine,
  thirty; a watch, eighty to 200; a 0.25-gallon bottle of alcohol, 400
  cigarettes!’
* The sum total of money in the world is about $60 trillion, yet the sum total
  of coins and banknotes is less than $6 trillion. 7 More than 90 per cent of
  all money – more than $50 trillion appearing in our accounts – exists only
  on computer servers.
* Because money can convert, store and transport wealth easily and cheaply, it
  made a vital contribution to the appearance of complex commercial networks and
  dynamic markets.
* Take a dollar bill and look at it carefully. You will see that it is simply a
  colourful piece of paper with the signature of the US secretary of the
  treasury on one side, and the slogan ‘In God We Trust’ on the other. We
  accept the dollar in payment, because we trust in God and the US secretary of
  the treasury. The crucial role of trust explains why our financial systems are
  so tightly bound up with our political, social and ideological systems, why
  financial crises are often triggered by political developments, and why the
  stock market can rise or fall depending on the way traders feel on a
  particular morning.
* Almost all coins in use today are descendants of the Lydian coins.
* More importantly, the mark on the coin is the signature of some political
  authority that guarantees the coin’s value.
* The name ‘denarius’ became a generic name for coins. Muslim caliphs
  Arabicised this name and issued ‘dinars’. The dinar is still the official
  name of the currency in Jordan, Iraq, Serbia, Macedonia, Tunisia and several
  other countries.
* People continued to speak mutually incomprehensible languages, obey different
  rulers and worship distinct gods, but all believed in gold and silver and in
  gold and silver coins.
* For thousands of years, philosophers, thinkers and prophets have besmirched
  money and called it the root of all evil. Be that as it may, money is also the
  apogee of human tolerance. Money is more open-minded than language, state
  laws, cultural codes, religious beliefs and social habits. Money is the only
  trust system created by humans that can bridge almost any cultural gap, and
  that does not discriminate on the basis of religion, gender, race, age or
  sexual orientation.
* As money brings down the dams of community, religion and state, the world is
  in danger of becoming one big and rather heartless marketplace.
* Hence the economic history of humankind is a delicate dance. People rely on
  money to facilitate cooperation with strangers, but they’re afraid it will
  corrupt human values and intimate relations. With one hand people willingly
  destroy the communal dams that held at bay the movement of money and commerce
  for so long. Yet with the other hand they build new dams to protect society,
  religion and the environment from enslavement to market forces.
* An empire that cannot sustain a blow and remain standing is not really an
  empire.

Eventually, in 134 BC, Roman patience snapped. The Senate decided to send Scipio
Aemilianus, Rome’s foremost general and the man who had levelled Carthage, to
take care of the Numantians. He was given a massive army of more than 30,000
soldiers. Scipio, who respected the fighting spirit and martial skill of the
Numantians, preferred not to waste his soldiers in unnecessary combat. Instead,
he encircled Numantia with a line of fortifications, blocking the town’s contact
with the outside world. Hunger did his work for him. After more than a year, the
food supply ran out. When the Numantians realised that all hope was lost, they
burned down their town; according to Roman accounts, most of them killed
themselves so as not to become Roman slaves.

Yet Spanish patriots extol the Numantians in Spanish – a romance language that
is a progeny of Scipio’s Latin. The Numantians spoke a now dead and lost Celtic
language.

Cervantes wrote The Siege of Numantia in Latin script, and the play follows
Graeco-Roman artistic models. Numantia had no theatres. Spanish patriots who
admire Numantian heroism tend also to be loyal followers of the Roman Catholic
Church – don’t miss that first word – a church whose leader still sits in Rome
and whose God prefers to be addressed in Latin.

Similarly, modern Spanish law derives from Roman law; Spanish politics is built
on Roman foundations; and Spanish cuisine and architecture owe a far greater
debt to Roman legacies than to those of the Celts of Iberia. Nothing is really
left of Numantia save ruins. Even its story has reached us thanks only to the
writings of Roman historians. It was tailored to the tastes of Roman audiences
which relished tales of freedom-loving barbarians. The victory of Rome over
Numantia was so complete that the victors co-opted the very memory of the
vanquished.

It should be stressed that an empire is defined solely by its cultural diversity
and flexible borders, rather than by its origins, its form of government, its
territorial extent, or the size of its population.

Empires were one of the main reasons for the drastic reduction in human
diversity. The imperial steamroller gradually obliterated the unique
characteristics of numerous peoples (such as the Numantians), forging out of
them new and much larger groups.

In our time, ‘imperialist’ ranks second only to ‘fascist’ in the lexicon of
political swear words.

The truth is that empire has been the world’s most common form of political
organisation for the last 2,500 years.

In general, they have been toppled only by external invasion or by a split
within the ruling elite. Conversely, conquered peoples don’t have a very good
record of freeing themselves from their imperial overlords.

Building and maintaining an empire usually required the vicious slaughter of
large populations and the brutal oppression of every-one who was left. The
standard imperial toolkit included wars, enslavement, deportation and genocide.

When the Romans invaded Scotland in AD 83, they were met by fierce resistance
from local Caledonian tribes, and reacted by laying waste to the country. In
reply to Roman peace offers, the chieftain Calgacus called the Romans ‘the
ruffians of the world’, and said that ‘to plunder, slaughter and robbery they
give the lying name of empire; they make a desert and call it peace’.

Today most of us speak, think and dream in imperial languages that were forced
upon our ancestors by the sword. Most East Asians speak and dream in the
language of the Han Empire. No matter what their origins, nearly all the
inhabitants of the two American continents, from Alaska’s Barrow Peninsula to
the Straits of Magellan, communicate in one of four imperial languages: Spanish,
Portuguese, French or English.

Present-day Egyptians speak Arabic, think of themselves as Arabs, and identify
wholeheartedly with the Arab Empire that conquered Egypt in the seventh century
and crushed with an iron fist the repeated revolts that broke out against its
rule.

About 10 million Zulus in South Africa hark back to the Zulu age of glory in the
nineteenth century, even though most of them descend from tribes who fought
against the Zulu Empire, and were incorporated into it only through bloody
military campaigns.

The first empire about which we have definitive information was the Akkadian
Empire of Sargon the Great (c.2250 BC).

Sargon boasted that he had conquered the entire world. In reality, his dominion
stretched from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean, and included most of
today’s Iraq and Syria, along with a few slices of modern Iran and Turkey.

Evolution has made Homo sapiens, like other social mammals, a xenophobic
creature.

Sapiens instinctively divide humanity into two parts, ‘we’ and ‘they’.

In the language of the Dinka people of the Sudan, ‘Dinka’ simply means
‘people’. People who are not Dinka are not people. The Dinka’s bitter enemies
are the Nuer. What does the word Nuer mean in Nuer language? It means ‘original
people’.  Note: ahahahaha :) Edit Thousands of miles from the Sudan deserts, in
the frozen ice-lands of Alaska and north-eastern Siberia, live the Yupiks. What
does Yupik mean in Yupik language? It means ‘real people’.

According to traditional Chinese political theory, Heaven (Tian) is the source
of all legitimate authority on earth. Heaven chooses the most worthy person or
family and gives them the Mandate of Heaven. This person or family then rules
over All Under Heaven (Tianxia) for the benefit of all its inhabitants. Thus, a
legitimate authority is – by definition – universal.

In Chinese political thinking as well as Chinese historical memory, imperial
periods were henceforth seen as golden ages of order and justice. In
contradiction to the modern Western view that a just world is composed of
separate nation states, in China periods of political fragmentation were seen as
dark ages of chaos and injustice.

A second and equally important reason why empires actively spread a common
culture was to gain legitimacy. At least since the days of Cyrus and Qín Shĭ
Huángdì, empires have justified their actions – whether road-building or
bloodshed – as necessary to spread a superior culture from which the conquered
benefit even more than the conquerors.

The Mandate of Heaven was bestowed upon the emperor not in order to exploit the
world, but in order to educate humanity. The Romans, too, justified their
dominion by arguing that they were endowing the barbarians with peace, justice
and refinement.

The Mauryan Empire in the third century BC took as its mission the dissemination
of Buddha’s teachings to an ignorant world.

The Muslim caliphs received a divine mandate to spread the Prophet’s revelation,
peacefully if possible but by the sword if necessary.

The Spanish and Portuguese empires proclaimed that it was not riches they sought
in the Indies and America, but converts to the true faith.

The sun never set on the British mission to spread the twin gospels of
liberalism and free trade. The Soviets felt duty-bound to facilitate the
inexorable historical march from capitalism towards the utopian dictatorship of
the proletariat.

Many Americans nowadays maintain that their government has a moral imperative to
bring Third World countries the benefits of democracy and human rights, even if
these goods are delivered by cruise missiles and F-16s.

The imperial culture of Rome was Greek almost as much as Roman. The imperial
Abbasid culture was part Persian, part Greek, part Arab. Imperial Mongol culture
was a Chinese copycat. In the imperial United States, an American president of
Kenyan blood can munch on Italian pizza while watching his favourite film,
Lawrence of Arabia, a British epic about the Arab rebellion against the Turks.

Worse still, even when subject peoples were successful in adopting the imperial
culture, it could take decades, if not centuries, until the imperial elite
accepted them as part of ‘us’. The generations between conquest and acceptance
were left out in the cold. They had already lost their beloved local culture,
but they were not allowed to take an equal part in the imperial world.

He himself wears Roman tunics and, thanks to his success as a cattle merchant,
due in no small part to his expertise in the intricacies of Roman commercial
law, he has been able to build a Roman-style villa. Yet, even though he can
recite Book III of Virgil’s Georgics by heart, the Romans still treat him as
though he’s semi-barbarian.

In some cases the processes of acculturation and assimilation eventually broke
down the barriers between the newcomers and the old elite.

All the subjects of Rome eventually, after centuries of imperial rule, were
granted Roman citizenship. Non-Romans rose to occupy the top ranks in the
officer corps of the Roman legions and were appointed to the Senate.

In AD 48 the emperor Claudius admitted to the Senate several Gallic notables,
who, he noted in a speech, through ‘customs, culture, and the ties of marriage
have blended with ourselves’.

Snobbish senators protested introducing these former enemies into the heart of
the Roman political system. Claudius reminded them of an inconvenient
truth. Most of their own senatorial families descended from Italian tribes who
once fought against Rome, and were later granted Roman citizenship. Indeed, the
emperor reminded them, his own family was of Sabine ancestry.5

Emperor Septimius Severus (193–211) was the scion of a Punic family from
Libya. Elagabalus (218–22) was a Syrian. Emperor Philip (244–9) was known
colloquially as ‘Philip the Arab’. The empire’s new citizens adopted Roman
imperial culture with such zest that, for centuries and even millennia after the
empire itself collapsed, they continued to speak the empire’s language, to
believe in the Christian God that the empire had adopted from one of its
Levantine provinces, and to live by the empire’s laws.

A similar process occurred in the Arab Empire. When it was established in the
mid-seventh century AD, it was based on a sharp division between the ruling
Arab–Muslim elite and the subjugated Egyptians, Syrians, Iranians and Berbers,
who were neither Arabs nor Muslim.

Many of the empire’s subjects gradually adopted the Muslim faith, the Arabic
language and a hybrid imperial culture.

Eventually they got their way. Egyptians, Syrians and Mesopotamians were
increasingly seen as ‘Arabs’. Arabs, in their turn – whether ‘authentic’ Arabs
from Arabia or newly minted Arabs from Egypt and Syria – came to be increasingly
dominated by non-Arab Muslims, in particular by Iranians, Turks and Berbers.

The great success of the Arab imperial project was that the imperial culture it
created was wholeheartedly adopted by numerous non-Arab people, who continued to
uphold it, develop it and spread it – even after the original empire collapsed
and the Arabs as an ethnic group lost their dominion.

For the vast majority of empires were founded on blood, and maintained their
power through oppression and war. Yet most of today’s cultures are based on
imperial legacies. If empires are by definition bad, what does that say about
us?

Whatever path we take, the first step is to acknowledge the complexity of the
dilemma and to accept that simplistically dividing the past into good guys and
bad guys leads nowhere. Unless, of course, we are willing to admit that we
usually follow the lead of the bad guys.

As of 2014, the world is still politically fragmented, but states are fast
losing their independence. Not one of them is really able to execute independent
economic policies, to declare and wage wars as it pleases, or even to run its
own internal affairs as it sees fit.

Today religion is often considered a source of discrimination, disagreement and
disunion. Yet, in fact, religion has been the third great unifier of humankind,
alongside money and empires.

Since all social orders and hierarchies are imagined, they are all fragile, and
the larger the society, the more fragile it is.

Religion can thus be defined as a system of human norms and values that is
founded on a belief in a superhuman order.

Religions hold that there is a superhuman order, which is not the product of
human whims or agreements.

As far as we know, universal and missionary religions began to appear only in
the first millennium BC.

the first religious effect of the Agricultural Revolution was to turn plants and
animals from equal members of a spiritual round table into property.

As long as people lived their entire lives within limited territories of a few
hundred square miles, most of their needs could be met by local spirits. But
once kingdoms and trade networks expanded, people needed to contact entities
whose power and authority encompassed a whole kingdom or an entire trade basin.

Animists thought that humans were just one of many creatures inhabiting the
world. Polytheists, on the other hand, increasingly saw the world as a
reflection of the relationship between gods and humans.

Polytheism does not necessarily dispute the existence of a single power or law
governing the entire universe. In fact, most polytheist and even animist
religions recognised such a supreme power that stands behind all the different
gods, demons and holy rocks.

The fundamental insight of polytheism, which distinguishes it from monotheism,
is that the supreme power governing the world is devoid of interests and biases,
and therefore it is unconcerned with the mundane desires, cares and worries of
humans.

Polytheism is inherently open-minded, and rarely persecutes ‘heretics’ and
‘infidels’.

Even when polytheists conquered huge empires, they did not try to convert their
subjects. The Egyptians, the Romans and the Aztecs did not send missionaries to
foreign lands to spread the worship of Osiris, Jupiter or Huitzilopochtli (the
chief Aztec god), and they certainly didn’t dispatch armies for that purpose.

In the Aztec Empire, subject peoples were obliged to build temples for
Huitzilopochtli, but these temples were built alongside those of local gods,
rather than in their stead.

In many cases the imperial elite itself adopted the gods and rituals of subject
people. The Romans happily added the Asian goddess Cybele and the Egyptian
goddess Isis to their pantheon.

The only god that the Romans long refused to tolerate was the monotheistic and
evangelising god of the Christians.

The Roman Empire did not require the Christians to give up their beliefs and
rituals, but it did expect them to pay respect to the empire’s protector gods
and to the divinity of the emperor.

When the Christians vehemently refused to do so, and went on to reject all
attempts at compromise, the Romans reacted by persecuting what they understood
to be a politically subversive faction.

In the 300 years from the crucifixion of Christ to the conversion of Emperor
Constantine, polytheistic Roman emperors initiated no more than four general
persecutions of Christians.

Still, if we combine all the victims of all these persecutions, it turns out
that in these three centuries, the polytheistic Romans killed no more than a few
thousand Christians.1

In contrast, over the course of the next 1,500 years, Christians slaughtered
Christians by the millions to defend slightly different interpretations of the
religion of love and compassion.

Protestants believed that the divine love is so great that God was incarnated in
flesh and allowed Himself to be tortured and crucified, thereby redeeming the
original sin and opening the gates of heaven to all those who professed faith in
Him. Catholics maintained that faith, while essential, was not enough. To enter
heaven, believers had to participate in church rituals and do good deeds.

These theological disputes turned so violent that during the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, Catholics and Protestants killed each other by the
hundreds of thousands.

On 23 August 1572, French Catholics who stressed the importance of good deeds
attacked communities of French Protestants who highlighted God’s love for
humankind. In this attack, the St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre, between 5,000 and
10,000 Protestants were slaughtered in less than twenty-four hours.

When the pope in Rome heard the news from France, he was so overcome by joy that
he organised festive prayers to celebrate the occasion and commissioned Giorgio
Vasari to decorate one of the Vatican’s rooms with a fresco of the massacre (the
room is currently off-limits to visitors).

The first monotheist religion known to us appeared in Egypt, c.1350 BC, when
Pharaoh Akhenaten declared that one of the minor deities of the Egyptian
pantheon, the god Aten, was, in fact, the supreme power ruling the universe.

The big breakthrough came with Christianity. This faith began as an esoteric
Jewish sect that sought to convince Jews that Jesus of Nazareth was their
long-awaited messiah. However, one of the sect’s first leaders, Paul of Tarsus,
reasoned that if the supreme power of the universe has interests and biases, and
if He had bothered to incarnate Himself in the flesh and to die on the cross for
the salvation of humankind, then this is something everyone should hear about,
not just Jews.

In one of history’s strangest twists, this esoteric Jewish sect took over the
mighty Roman Empire.

Christian success served as a model for another monotheist religion that
appeared in the Arabian peninsula in the seventh century – Islam.

Like Christianity, Islam, too, began as a small sect in a remote corner of the
world, but in an even stranger and swifter historical surprise it managed to
break out of the deserts of Arabia and conquer an immense empire stretching from
the Atlantic Ocean to India.

Monotheists have tended to be far more fanatical and missionary than
polytheists. A religion that recognises the legitimacy of other faiths implies
either that its god is not the supreme power of the universe, or that it
received from God just part of the universal truth.

At the beginning of the first century AD, there were hardly any monotheists in
the world. Around AD 500, one of the world’s largest empires – the Roman Empire
– was a Christian polity, and missionaries were busy spreading Christianity to
other parts of Europe, Asia and Africa.

By the end of the first millennium AD, most people in Europe, West Asia and
North Africa were monotheists, and empires from the Atlantic Ocean to the
Himalayas claimed to be ordained by the single great God.

By the early sixteenth century, monotheism dominated most of Afro-Asia, with the
exception of East Asia and the southern parts of Africa, and it began extending
long tentacles towards South Africa, America and Oceania.

Today most people outside East Asia adhere to one monotheist religion or
another, and the global political order is built on monotheistic foundations.

Just as the god Jupiter defended Rome and Huitzilopochtli protected the Aztec
Empire, so every Christian kingdom had its own patron saint who helped it
overcome difficulties and win wars. England was protected by St George, Scotland
by St Andrew, Hungary by St Stephen, and France had St Martin.

Cities and towns, professions, and even diseases – each had their own saint. The
city of Milan had St Ambrose, while St Mark watched over Venice. St Florian
protected chimney cleaners, whereas St Mathew lent a hand to tax collectors in
distress. If you suffered from headaches you had to pray to St Agathius, but if
from toothaches, then St Apollonia was a much better audience.

The Christian saints did not merely resemble the old polytheistic gods. Often
they were these very same gods in disguise.

For example, the chief goddess of Celtic Ireland prior to the coming of
Christianity was Brigid. When Ireland was Christianised, Brigid too was
baptised. She became St Brigit, who to this day is the most revered saint in
Catholic Ireland.

Dualistic religions espouse the existence of two opposing powers: good and
evil. Unlike monotheism, dualism believes that evil is an independent power,
neither created by the good God, nor subordinate to it.

Dualism explains that the entire universe is a battleground between these two
forces, and that everything that happens in the world is part of the struggle.

Monotheists have to practise intellectual gymnastics to explain how an
all-knowing, all-powerful and perfectly good God allows so much suffering in the
world.

One well-known explanation is that this is God’s way of allowing for human free
will.

Freedom of will allows humans to choose evil. Many indeed choose evil and,
according to the standard monotheist account, this choice must bring divine
punishment in its wake.

If God knew in advance that a particular person would use her free will to
choose evil, and that as a result she would be punished for this by eternal
tortures in hell, why did God create her?

For dualists, it’s easy to explain evil. Bad things happen even to good people
because the world is not governed single-handedly by a good God.

Dualism has its own drawbacks. While solving the Problem of Evil, it is unnerved
by the Problem of Order. If the world was created by a single God, it’s clear
why it is such an orderly place, where everything obeys the same laws. But if
Good and Evil battle for control of the world, who enforces the laws governing
this cosmic war?

A missile launched from Pakistan can hit targets in India because gravity works
the same way in both countries. When Good and Evil fight, what common laws do
they obey, and who decreed these laws?

So, monotheism explains order, but is mystified by evil. Dualism explains evil,
but is puzzled by order. There is one logical way of solving the riddle: to
argue that there is a single omnipotent God who created the entire universe –
and He’s evil. But nobody in history has had the stomach for such a belief.

Dualistic religions flourished for more than a thousand years. Sometime between
1500 BC and 1000 BC a prophet named Zoroaster (Zarathustra) was active somewhere
in Central Asia.

His creed passed from generation to generation until it became the most
important of dualistic religions – Zoroastrianism. Zoroastrians saw the world as
a cosmic battle between the good god Ahura Mazda and the evil god Angra Mainyu.

Zoroastrianism was an important religion during the Achaemenid Persian Empire
(550–330 BC) and later became the official religion of the Sassanid Persian
Empire (AD 224–651). It exerted a major influence on almost all subsequent
Middle Eastern and Central Asian religions, and it inspired a number of other
dualist religions, such as Gnosticism and Manichaeanism.

During the third and fourth centuries AD, the Manichaean creed spread from China
to North Africa, and for a moment it appeared that it would beat Christianity to
achieve dominance in the Roman Empire.

Yet the Manichaeans lost the soul of Rome to the Christians, the Zoroastrian
Sassanid Empire was overrun by the monotheistic Muslims, and the dualist wave
subsided. Today only a handful of dualist communities survive in India and the
Middle East.

Nevertheless, the rising tide of monotheism did not really wipe out
dualism. Jewish, Christian and Muslim monotheism absorbed numerous dualist
beliefs and practices, and some of the most basic ideas of what we call
‘monotheism’ are, in fact, dualist in origin and spirit.

Countless Christians, Muslims and Jews believe in a powerful evil force – like
the one Christians call the Devil or Satan – who can act independently, fight
against the good God, and wreak havoc without God’s permission.

How can a monotheist adhere to such a dualistic belief (which, by the way, is
nowhere to be found in the Old Testament)? Logically, it is impossible. Either
you believe in a single omnipotent God or you believe in two opposing powers,
neither of which is omnipotent.

Still, humans have a wonderful capacity to believe in contradictions.

So it should not come as a surprise that millions of pious Christians, Muslims
and Jews manage to believe at one and the same time in an omnipotent God and an
independent Devil.

Countless Christians, Muslims and Jews have gone so far as to imagine that the
good God even needs our help in its struggle against the Devil, which inspired
among other things the call for jihads and crusades.

Another key dualistic concept, particularly in Gnosticism and Manichaeanism, was
the sharp distinction between body and soul, between matter and spirit.

Gnostics and Manichaeans argued that the good god created the spirit and the
soul, whereas matter and bodies are the creation of the evil god. Man, according
to this view, serves as a battleground between the good soul and the evil body.

From a monotheistic perspective, this is nonsense – why distinguish so sharply
between body and soul, or matter and spirit? And why argue that body and matter
are evil? After all, everything was created by the same good God.

So such oppositions eventually became cornerstones of Christian and Muslim
thought. Belief in heaven (the realm of the good god) and hell (the realm of the
evil god) was also dualist in origin.

There is no trace of this belief in the Old Testament, which also never claims
that the souls of people continue to live after the death of the body.

In fact, monotheism, as it has played out in history, is a kaleidoscope of
monotheist, dualist, polytheist and animist legacies, jumbling together under a
single divine umbrella.

The average Christian believes in the monotheist God, but also in the dualist
Devil, in polytheist saints, and in animist ghosts.

Scholars of religion have a name for this simultaneous avowal of different and
even contradictory ideas and the combination of rituals and practices taken from
different sources. It’s called syncretism. Syncretism might, in fact, be the
single great world religion.

During the first millennium BC, religions of an altogether new kind began to
spread through Afro-Asia. The newcomers, such as Jainism and Buddhism in India,
Daoism and Confucianism in China, and Stoicism, Cynicism and Epicureanism in the
Mediterranean basin, were characterised by their disregard of gods.

Some of these natural-law religions continued to espouse the existence of gods,
but their gods were subject to the laws of nature no less than humans, animals
and plants were.

The central figure of Buddhism is not a god but a human being, Siddhartha
Gautama. According to Buddhist tradition, Gautama was heir to a small Himalayan
kingdom, sometime around 500 BC.

At the age of twenty-nine Gautama slipped away from his palace in the middle of
the night, leaving behind his family and possessions. He travelled as a homeless
vagabond throughout northern India, searching for a way out of suffering.

He spent six years meditating on the essence, causes and cures for human
anguish. In the end he came to the realisation that suffering is not caused by
ill fortune, by social injustice, or by divine whims. Rather, suffering is
caused by the behaviour patterns of one’s own mind.

When the mind experiences something distasteful it craves to be rid of the
irritation. When the mind experiences something pleasant, it craves that the
pleasure will remain and will intensify. Therefore, the mind is always
dissatisfied and restless.

But how do you get the mind to accept things as they are, without craving? To
accept sadness as sadness, joy as joy, pain as pain? Gautama developed a set of
meditation techniques that train the mind to experience reality as it is,
without craving.

According to Buddhist tradition, Gautama himself attained nirvana and was fully
liberated from suffering. Henceforth he was known as ‘Buddha’, which means ‘The
Enlightened One’. Buddha spent the rest of his life explaining his discoveries
to others so that everyone could be freed from suffering.

He encapsulated his teachings in a single law: suffering arises from craving;
the only way to be fully liberated from suffering is to be fully liberated from
craving; and the only way to be liberated from craving is to train the mind to
experience reality as it is. This law, known as dharma or dhamma, is seen by
Buddhists as a universal law of nature.

Buddhists are people who believe in this law and make it the fulcrum of all
their activities. Belief in gods, on the other hand, is of minor importance to
them.

The first principle of monotheist religions is ‘God exists. What does He want
from me?’ The first principle of Buddhism is ‘Suffering exists. How do I escape
it?’

Buddhism told people that they should aim for the ultimate goal of complete
liberation from suffering, rather than for stops along the way such as economic
prosperity and political power.

However, 99 per cent of Buddhists did not attain nirvana, and even if they hoped
to do so in some future lifetime, they devoted most of their present lives to
the pursuit of mundane achievements. So they continued to worship various gods,
such as the Hindu gods in India, the Bon gods in Tibet, and the Shinto gods in
Japan.

Moreover, as time went by several Buddhist sects developed pantheons of Buddhas
and bodhisattvas. These are human and non-human beings with the capacity to
achieve full liberation from suffering but who forego this liberation out of
compassion, in order to help the countless beings still trapped in the cycle of
misery.

Instead of worshipping gods, many Buddhists began worshipping these enlightened
beings, asking them for help not only in attaining nirvana, but also in dealing
with mundane problems.

The last 300 years are often depicted as an age of growing secularism, in which
religions have increasingly lost their importance. If we are talking about
theist religions, this is largely correct.

But if we take into consideration natural-law religions, then modernity turns
out to be an age of intense religious fervour, unparalleled missionary efforts,
and the bloodiest wars of religion in history.

The modern age has witnessed the rise of a number of new natural-law religions,
such as liberalism, Communism, capitalism, nationalism and Nazism.

Just as a Buddhist could worship Hindu deities, and just as a monotheist could
believe in the existence of Satan, so the typical American nowadays is
simultaneously a nationalist (she believes in the existence of an American
nation with a special role to play in history), a free-market capitalist (she
believes that open competition and the pursuit of self-interest are the best
ways to create a prosperous society), and a liberal humanist (she believes that
humans have been endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights).

Humanism is a belief that Homo sapiens has a unique and sacred nature, which is
fundamentally different from the nature of all other animals and of all other
phenomena.

Humanists believe that the unique nature of Homo sapiens is the most important
thing in the world, and it determines the meaning of everything that happens in
the universe.

The supreme good is the good of Homo sapiens. The rest of the world and all
other beings exist solely for the benefit of this species.

All humanists worship humanity, but they do not agree on its definition.

Today, the most important humanist sect is liberal humanism, which believes that
‘humanity’ is a quality of individual humans, and that the liberty of
individuals is therefore sacrosanct.

According to liberals, the sacred nature of humanity resides within each and
every individual Homo sapiens. The inner core of individual humans gives meaning
to the world, and is the source for all ethical and political authority.

If we encounter an ethical or political dilemma, we should look inside and
listen to our inner voice – the voice of humanity.

The chief commandments of liberal humanism are meant to protect the liberty of
this inner voice against intrusion or harm. These commandments are collectively
known as ‘human rights’.

Attending gruesome executions was a favourite pastime for Londoners and
Parisians in the era of Shakespeare and Molière. In today’s Europe, murder is
seen as a violation of the sacred nature of humanity. In order to restore order,
present-day Europeans do not torture and execute criminals.

Even though liberal humanism sanctifies humans, it does not deny the existence
of God, and is, in fact, founded on monotheist beliefs. The liberal belief in
the free and sacred nature of each individual is a direct legacy of the
traditional Christian belief in free and eternal individual souls.

Without recourse to eternal souls and a Creator God, it becomes embarrassingly
difficult for liberals to explain what is so special about individual Sapiens.

Another important sect is socialist humanism. Socialists believe that ‘humanity’
is collective rather than individualistic. They hold as sacred not the inner
voice of each individual, but the species Homo sapiens as a whole.

Whereas liberal humanism seeks as much freedom as possible for individual
humans, socialist humanism seeks equality between all humans.

According to socialists, inequality is the worst blasphemy against the sanctity
of humanity, because it privileges peripheral qualities of humans over their
universal essence.

Like liberal humanism, socialist humanism is built on monotheist
foundations. The idea that all humans are equal is a revamped version of the
monotheist conviction that all souls are equal before God.

The only humanist sect that has actually broken loose from traditional
monotheism is evolutionary humanism, whose most famous representatives are the
Nazis. What distinguished the Nazis from other humanist sects was a different
definition of ‘humanity’, one deeply influenced by the theory of evolution.

In contrast to other humanists, the Nazis believed that humankind is not
something universal and eternal, but rather a mutable species that can evolve or
degenerate. Man can evolve into superman, or degenerate into a subhuman.

The main ambition of the Nazis was to protect humankind from degeneration and
encourage its progressive evolution. This is why the Nazis said that the Aryan
race, the most advanced form of humanity, had to be protected and fostered,
while degenerate kinds of Homo sapiens like Jews, Roma, homosexuals and the
mentally ill had to be quarantined and even exterminated.

Biologists have since debunked Nazi racial theory. In particular, genetic
research conducted after 1945 has demonstrated that the differences between the
various human lineages are far smaller than the Nazis postulated.

Given the state of scientific knowledge in 1933, Nazi beliefs were hardly
outside the pale. The existence of different human races, the superiority of the
white race, and the need to protect and cultivate this superior race were widely
held beliefs among most Western elites.

At the dawn of the third millennium, the future of evolutionary humanism is
unclear. For sixty years after the end of the war against Hitler it was taboo to
link humanism with evolution and to advocate using biological methods to
‘upgrade’ Homo sapiens.

At the same time, a huge gulf is opening between the tenets of liberal humanism
and the latest findings of the life sciences, a gulf we cannot ignore much
longer.

Our liberal political and judicial systems are founded on the belief that every
individual has a sacred inner nature, indivisible and immutable, which gives
meaning to the world, and which is the source of all ethical and political
authority.

Yet over the last 200 years, the life sciences have thoroughly undermined this
belief. Scientists studying the inner workings of the human organism have found
no soul there. They increasingly argue that human behaviour is determined by
hormones, genes and synapses, rather than by free will – the same forces that
determine the behaviour of chimpanzees, wolves, and ants.

When Constantine assumed the throne in 306, Christianity was little more than an
esoteric Eastern sect. If you were to suggest then that it was about to become
the Roman state religion, you’d have been laughed out of the room just as you
would be today if you were to suggest that by the year 2050 Hare Krishna would
be the state religion of the USA.

Indeed, had the Byzantine army been able to repel the initial onslaught, Islam
would probably have remained an obscure cult of which only a handful of
cognoscenti were aware.

Scholars would then have a very easy job explaining why a faith based on a
revelation to a middle-aged Meccan merchant could never have caught on.

To acknowledge that history is not deterministic is to acknowledge that it is
just a coincidence that most people today believe in nationalism, capitalism and
human rights.

Chaotic systems come in two shapes. Level one chaos is chaos that does not react
to predictions about it. The weather, for example, is a level one chaotic
system. Though it is influenced by myriad factors, we can build computer models
that take more and more of them into consideration, and produce better and
better weather forecasts.

Level two chaos is chaos that reacts to predictions about it, and therefore can
never be predicted accurately. Markets, for example, are a level two chaotic
system. What will happen if we develop a computer program that forecasts with
100 per cent accuracy the price of oil tomorrow? The price of oil will
immediately react to the forecast, which would consequently fail to materialise.

It may well be that we’d all be better off if Christianity and Islam had been
forgotten or defeated.

When Pakistan buys advanced aeroplanes, India responds in kind. When India
develops nuclear bombs, Pakistan follows suit. When Pakistan enlarges its navy,
India counters. At the end of the process, the balance of power may remain much
as it was, but meanwhile billions of dollars that could have been invested in
education or health are spent on weapons.

Around AD 1500, history made its most momentous choice, changing not only the
fate of humankind, but arguably the fate of all life on earth. We call it the
Scientific Revolution. It began in western Europe, a large peninsula on the
western tip of Afro-Asia, which up till then played no important role in
history.

In the year 1500, there were about 500 million Homo sapiens in the entire
world. Today, there are 7 billion.1

The total value of goods and services produced by humankind in the year 1500 is
estimated at $250 billion, in today’s dollars.2 Nowadays the value of a year of
human production is close to $60 trillion.3

Prior to the sixteenth century, no human had circumnavigated the earth. This
changed in 1522, when Magellan’s expedition returned to Spain after a journey of
44,000 miles. It took three years and cost the lives of almost all the crew
members, Magellan included.

In 1873, Jules Verne could imagine that Phileas Fogg, a wealthy British
adventurer, might just be able to make it around the world in eighty days. Today
anyone with a middle-class income can safely and easily circumnavigate the globe
in just forty-eight hours.

During the previous 4 billion years of evolution, no organism managed even to
leave the earth’s atmosphere, and certainly none left a foot or tentacle print
on the moon.

For most of history, humans knew nothing about 99.99 per cent of the organisms
on the planet – namely, the microorganisms.

They are our best friends, and deadliest enemies. Some of them digest our food
and clean our guts, while others cause illnesses and epidemics.

Yet it was only in 1674 that a human eye first saw a microorganism, when Anton
van Leeuwenhoek took a peek through his home-made microscope and was startled to
see an entire world of tiny creatures milling about in a drop of water.

But the single most remarkable and defining moment of the past 500 years came at
05:29:45 on 16 July 1945. At that precise second, American scientists detonated
the first atomic bomb at Alamogordo, New Mexico. From that point onward,
humankind had the capability not only to change the course of history, but to
end it.

Modern science is based on the Latin injunction ignoramus – ‘we do not know’. It
assumes that we don’t know everything. Even more critically, it accepts that the
things that we think we know could be proven wrong as we gain more knowledge. No
concept, idea or theory is sacred and beyond challenge.

The great discovery that launched the Scientific Revolution was the discovery
that humans do not know the answers to their most important questions.

Premodern traditions of knowledge such as Islam, Christianity, Buddhism and
Confucianism asserted that everything that is important to know about the world
was already known.

Even science itself has to rely on religious and ideological beliefs to justify
and finance its research.

In 1687, Isaac Newton published The Mathematical Principles of Natural
Philosophy, arguably the most important book in modern history.

The greatness of Newton’s theory was its ability to explain and predict the
movements of all bodies in the universe, from falling apples to shooting stars,
using three very simple mathematical laws:

In medieval Europe, logic, grammar and rhetoric formed the educational core,
while the teaching of mathematics seldom went beyond simple arithmetic and
geometry.

In 1620 Francis Bacon published a scientific manifesto titled The New
Instrument. In it he argued that ‘knowledge is power’. The real test of
‘knowledge’ is not whether it is true, but whether it empowers us.

In fact, the relationship between science and technology is a very recent
phenomenon. Prior to 1500, science and technology were totally separate fields.

A good historian can find precedent for everything.

Here and there people did develop new technologies, but these were usually
created by uneducated craftsmen using trial and error, not by scholars pursuing
systematic scientific research.

The world’s military forces initiate, fund and steer a large part of humanity’s
scientific research and technological development.

The most important military invention in the history of China was gunpowder. Yet
to the best of our knowledge, gunpowder was invented accidentally, by Daoist
alchemists searching for the elixir of life.

The Napoleonic military machine that crushed the armies of the European powers
at Austerlitz (1805) was armed with more or less the same weaponry that the army
of Louis XVI had used.

The story of the Tower of Babel, the story of Icarus, the story of the Golem and
countless other myths taught people that any attempt to go beyond human
limitations would inevitably lead to disappointment and disaster.

According to the New Testament, shortly before the crucifixion a woman anointed
Christ with precious oil worth 300 denarii. Jesus’ disciples scolded the woman
for wasting such a huge sum of money instead of giving it to the poor, but Jesus
defended her, saying that ‘The poor you will always have with you, and you can
help them any time you want. But you will not always have me’ (Mark 14:7).

In fact, in many societies more people are in danger of dying from obesity than
from starvation.

The best minds were busy giving meaning to death, not trying to escape it.

For men of science, death is not an inevitable destiny, but merely a technical
problem. People die not because the gods decreed it, but due to various
technical failures – a heart attack, cancer, an infection.

In 1199, King Richard the Lionheart was struck by an arrow in his left
shoulder. Today we’d say he incurred a minor injury. But in 1199, in the absence
of antibiotics and effective sterilisation methods, this minor flesh wound
turned infected and gangrene set in.

As recently as the nineteenth century, the best doctors still did not know how
to prevent infection and stop the putrefaction of tissues. In field hospitals
doctors routinely cut off the hands and legs of soldiers who received even minor
limb injuries, fearing gangrene.

The first anaesthetics – ether, chloroform and morphine – entered regular usage
in Western medicine only in the middle of the nineteenth century.

On the morning after the battle of Waterloo (1815), heaps of sawn-off hands and
legs could be seen adjacent to the field hospitals. In those days, carpenters
and butchers who enlisted to the army were often sent to serve in the medical
corps, because surgery required little more than knowing your way with knives
and saws.

The average life expectancy jumped from around twenty-five to forty years, to
around sixty-seven in the entire world, and to around eighty years in the
developed world.8

Until the twentieth century, between a quarter and a third of the children of
agricultural societies never reached adulthood.

In seventeenth-century England, 150 out of every 1,000 newborns died during
their first year, and a third of all children were dead before they reached
fifteen.9

Today, only five out of 1,000 English babies die during their first year, and
only seven out of 1,000 die before age fifteen.10

A good example is the family of King Edward I of England (1237–1307) and his
wife, Queen Eleanor (1241–90). Their children enjoyed the best conditions and
the most nurturing surroundings that could be provided in medieval Europe. They
lived in palaces, ate as much food as they liked, had plenty of warm clothing,
well-stocked fireplaces, the cleanest water available, an army of servants and
the best doctors. The sources mention sixteen children that Queen Eleanor bore
between 1255 and 1284:

In other words, it took Eleanor sixteen tries to carry out the most fundamental
mission of an English queen – to provide her husband with a male heir.

Nevertheless, ten out of the sixteen – 62 per cent – died during childhood. Only
six managed to live beyond the age of eleven, and only three – just 18 per cent
– lived beyond the age of forty. In addition to these births, Eleanor most
likely had a number of pregnancies that ended in miscarriage.

A few serious scholars suggest that by 2050, some humans will become a-mortal
(not immortal, because they could still die of some accident, but a-mortal,
meaning that in the absence of fatal trauma their lives could be extended
indefinitely).

The only modern ideology that still awards death a central role is

nationalism.

Most scientific studies are funded because somebody believes they can help
attain some political, economic or religious goal.

At the time, ships that set sail to distant shores knew that more than half
their crew members would die on the journey. The nemesis was not angry natives,
enemy warships or homesickness. It was a mysterious ailment called scurvy. Men
who came down with the disease grew lethargic and depressed, and their gums and
other soft tissues bled.

Between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, scurvy is estimated to have
claimed the lives of about 2 million sailors.

The turning point came in 1747, when a British physician, James Lind, conducted
a controlled experiment on sailors who suffered from the disease.

One of the test groups was instructed to eat citrus fruits, a common folk remedy
for scurvy. The patients in this group promptly recovered. Lind did not know
what the citrus fruits had that the sailors’ bodies lacked, but we now know that
it is vitamin C.

Cook claimed for Britain many of the islands and lands he ‘discovered’, most
notably Australia. The Cook expedition laid the foundation for the British
occupation of the south-western Pacific Ocean; for the conquest of Australia,
Tasmania and New Zealand; for the settlement of millions of Europeans in the new
colonies; and for the extermination of their native cultures and most of their
native populations.2

The native population dropped by up to 90 per cent and the survivors were
subjected to a harsh regime of racial oppression. For the Aborigines of
Australia and the Maoris of New Zealand, the Cook expedition was the beginning
of a catastrophe from which they have never recovered.

An even worse fate befell the natives of Tasmania. Having survived for 10,000
years in splendid isolation, they were completely wiped out, to the last man,
woman and child, within a century of Cook’s arrival.

Even the Roman Empire – the only important premodern European empire – derived
most of its wealth from its North African, Balkan and Middle Eastern provinces.

The early modern era was a golden age for the Ottoman Empire in the
Mediterranean, the Safavid Empire in Persia, the Mughal Empire in India, and the
Chinese Ming and Qing dynasties.

The global centre of power shifted to Europe only between 1750 and 1850, when
Europeans humiliated the Asian powers in a series of wars and conquered large
parts of Asia.

By 1900 Europeans firmly controlled the world’s economy and most of its
territory. In 1950 western Europe and the United States together accounted for
more than half of global production, whereas China’s portion had been reduced to
5 per cent.4

Today all humans are, to a much greater extent than they usually want to admit,
European in dress, thought and taste.

The world’s first commercial railroad opened for business in 1830, in
Britain. By 1850, Western nations were criss-crossed by almost 25,000 miles of
railroads – but in the whole of Asia, Africa and Latin America there were only
2,500 miles of tracks.

In 1880, the West boasted more than 220,000 miles of railroads, whereas in the
rest of the world there were but 22,000 miles of train lines (and most of these
were laid by the British in India).

The first railroad in China opened only in 1876. It was 15 miles long and built
by Europeans – the Chinese government destroyed it the following year.

In 1880 the Chinese Empire did not operate a single railroad.

The first railroad in Persia was built only in 1888, and it connected Tehran
with a Muslim holy site about 6 miles south of the capital. It was constructed
and operated by a Belgian company.

In 1950, the total railway network of Persia still amounted to a meagre 1,500
miles, in a country seven times the size of Britain.6

The Chinese and Persians did not lack technological inventions such as steam
engines (which could be freely copied or bought). They lacked the values, myths,
judicial apparatus and sociopolitical structures that took centuries to form and
mature in the West and which could not be copied and internalised rapidly.

Europeans were used to thinking and behaving in a scientific and capitalist way
even before they enjoyed any significant technological advantages.

The Far East and the Islamic world produced minds as intelligent and curious as
those of Europe. However, between 1500 and 1950 they did not produce anything
that comes even close to Newtonian physics or Darwinian biology.

When Napoleon invaded Egypt in 1798, he took 165 scholars with him. Among other
things, they founded an entirely new discipline, Egyptology, and made important
contributions to the study of religion, linguistics and botany.

After several professional geologists refused his invitation, the captain
offered the job to a twenty-two-year-old Cambridge graduate, Charles Darwin.

The captain spent his time on the voyage drawing military maps while Darwin
collected the empirical data and formulated the insights that would eventually
become the theory of evolution.

There is poetic justice in the fact that a quarter of the world, and two of its
seven continents, are named after a little-known Italian whose sole claim to
fame is that he had the courage to say, ‘We don’t know.’

Thus the Romans conquered Etruria in order to defend Rome (c.350–300 BC). They
then conquered the Po Valley in order to defend Etruria (c.200 BC). They
subsequently conquered Provence to defend the Po Valley (c.120 BC), Gaul to
defend Provence (c.50 BC), and Britain in order to defend Gaul (c. AD 50).

It took them 400 years to get from Rome to London. In 350 BC, no Roman would
have conceived of sailing directly to Britain and conquering it.

Around 1517, Spanish colonists in the Caribbean islands began to hear vague
rumours about a powerful empire somewhere in the centre of the Mexican
mainland. A mere four years later, the Aztec capital was a smouldering ruin, the
Aztec Empire was a thing of the past, and Hernán Cortés lorded over a vast new
Spanish Empire in Mexico.

Yet within little more than ten years of the Spanish conquest of Mexico,
Francisco Pizarro had discovered the Inca Empire in South America, vanquishing
it in 1532.

Within twenty years, almost the entire native Caribbean population was wiped
out. The Spanish colonists began importing African slaves to fill the vacuum.

When the Spaniards first arrived in Mexico, natives bearing incense burners were
assigned to accompany them wherever they went. The Spaniards thought it was a
mark of divine honour. We know from native sources that they found the
newcomers’ smell unbearable.)

Within a century of the landing at Vera Cruz, the native population of the
Americas had shrunk by about 90 per cent, due mainly to unfamiliar diseases that
reached America with the invaders. The survivors found themselves under the
thumb of a greedy and racist regime that was far worse than that of the Aztecs.

Even puny European kingdoms such as Scotland and Denmark sent a few
explore-and-conquer expeditions to America, but not one expedition of either
exploration or conquest was ever sent to America from the Islamic world, India
or China.

The first non-European power that tried to send a military expedition to America
was Japan.

That happened in June 1942, when a Japanese expedition conquered Kiska and Attu,
two small islands off the Alaskan coast, capturing in the process ten US
soldiers and a dog. The Japanese never got any closer to the mainland.

The resources that sent Zheng He from China to East Africa in the 1420s should
have been enough to reach America. The Chinese just weren’t interested. The
first Chinese world map to show America was not issued until 1602 – and then by
a European missionary!

Only in the twentieth century did non-European cultures adopt a truly global
vision.

Thus in the Algerian War of Independence (1954–62), Algerian guerrillas defeated
a French army with an overwhelming numerical, technological and economic
advantage. The Algerians prevailed because they were supported by a global
anti-colonial network, and because they worked out how to harness the world’s
media to their cause – as well as public opinion in France itself.

When the Muslims conquered India, they did not bring along archaeologists to
systematically study Indian history, anthropologists to study Indian cultures,
geologists to study Indian soils, or zoologists to study Indian fauna.

When the British conquered India, they did all of these things.

Another telling example of British scientific curiosity was the deciphering of
cuneiform script. This was the main script used throughout the Middle East for
close to 3,000 years, but the last person able to read it probably died sometime
in the early first millennium AD.

Cuneiform came to the attention of Europeans in 1618, when the Spanish
ambassador in Persia went sightseeing in the ruins of ancient Persepolis, where
he saw inscriptions that nobody could explain to him.

In 1657 European scholars published the first transcription of a cuneiform text
from Persepolis.

Without the efforts of modern European imperialists such as Rawlinson, we would
not have known much about the fate of the ancient Middle Eastern empires.

Throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, fewer than 5,000
British officials, about 40,000–70,000 British soldiers, and perhaps another
100,000 British business people, hangers-on, wives and children were sufficient
to conquer and rule up to 300 million Indians.9

They created the world as we know it, including the ideologies we use in order
to judge them.

For better or worse, in sickness and in health, the modern economy has been
growing like a hormone-soused teenager. It eats up everything it can find and
puts on inches faster than you can count.

In 1500, global production of goods and services was equal to about $250
billion; today it hovers around $60 trillion.

More importantly, in 1500, annual per capita production averaged $550, while
today every man, woman and child produces, on the average, $8,800 a year.1

Banks are allowed to loan $10 for every dollar they actually possess, which
means that 90 per cent of all the money in our bank accounts is not covered by
actual coins and notes.2

If all of the account holders at Barclays Bank suddenly demand their money,
Barclays will promptly collapse (unless the government steps in to save it). The
same is true of Lloyds, Deutsche Bank, Citibank, and all other banks in the
world.

What enables banks – and the entire economy – to survive and flourish is our
trust in the future.

Credit arrangements of one kind or another have existed in all known human
cultures, going back at least to ancient Sumer.

‘It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich
man to enter into the kingdom of God’ (Matthew 19:24).

In 1776 the Scottish economist Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations,
probably the most important economics manifesto of all time.

Yet Smith’s claim that the selfish human urge to increase private profits is the
basis for collective wealth is one of the most revolutionary ideas in human
history – revolutionary not just from an economic perspective, but even more so
from a moral and political perspective.

What Smith says is, in fact, that greed is good, and that by becoming richer I
benefit everybody, not just myself. Egoism is altruism.

‘The profits of production must be reinvested in increasing production.’

Capital consists of money, goods and resources that are invested in
production. Wealth, on the other hand, is buried in the ground or wasted on
unproductive activities.

Ask a capitalist how to bring justice and political freedom to a place like
Zimbabwe or Afghanistan, and you are likely to get a lecture on how economic
affluence and a thriving middle class are essential for stable democratic
institutions, and about the need therefore to inculcate Afghan tribesmen in the
values of free enterprise, thrift

and self-reliance.

Capitalism played a decisive role not only in the rise of modern science, but
also in the emergence of European imperialism.

And it was European imperialism that created the capitalist credit system in the
first place.

Remember, too, that until the late eighteenth century, Asia was the world’s
economic powerhouse, meaning that Europeans had far less capital at their
disposal than the Chinese, Muslims or Indians.

The empires built by bankers and merchants in frock coats and top hats defeated
the empires built by kings and noblemen in gold clothes and shining armour.

Yet within eighty years the Dutch had not only secured their independence from
Spain, but had managed to replace the Spaniards and their Portuguese allies as
masters of the ocean highways, build a global Dutch empire, and become the
richest state in Europe.

The secret of Dutch success was credit. The Dutch burghers, who had little taste
for combat on land, hired mercenary armies to fight the Spanish for them.

Capital trickles away from dictatorial states that fail to defend private
individuals and their property. Instead, it flows into states upholding the rule
of law and private property.

Island after island fell to VOC mercenaries and a large part of Indonesia became
a VOC colony. VOC ruled Indonesia for close to 200 years. Only in 1800 did the
Dutch state assume control of Indonesia, making it a Dutch national colony for
the following 150 years.

Today some people warn that twenty-first-century corporations are accumulating
too much power. Early modern history shows just how far that can go if
businesses are allowed to pursue their self-interest unchecked.

While VOC operated in the Indian Ocean, the Dutch West Indies Company, or WIC,
plied the Atlantic.

In order to control trade on the important Hudson River, WIC built a settlement
called New Amsterdam on an island at the river’s mouth. The colony was
threatened by Indians and repeatedly attacked by the British, who eventually
captured it in 1664. The British changed its name to New York.

The remains of the wall built by WIC to defend its colony against Indians and
British are today paved over by the world’s most famous street – Wall Street.

In 1717 the Mississippi Company, chartered in France, set out to colonise the
lower Mississippi valley, establishing the city of New Orleans in the process.

In 1717 the lower Mississippi valley offered few attractions besides swamps and
alligators, yet the Mississippi Company spread tales of fabulous riches and
boundless opportunities.

Initially, shares were offered at 500 livres apiece. On 1 August 1719, shares
traded at 2,750 livres. By 30 August, they were worth 4,100 livres, and on 4
September, they reached 5,000 livres. On 2 December the price of a Mississippi
share crossed the threshold of 10,000 livres.

The Mississippi Bubble was one of history’s most spectacular financial
crashes. The royal French financial system never recuperated fully from the
blow. The way in which the Mississippi Company used its political clout to
manipulate share prices and fuel the buying frenzy caused the public to lose
faith in the French banking system and in the financial wisdom of the French
king.

Like the Dutch Empire before it, the British Empire was established and run
largely by private joint-stock companies based in the London stock exchange.

The first English settlements in North America were established in the early
seventeenth century by joint-stock companies such as the London Company, the
Plymouth Company, the Dorchester Company and the Massachusetts Company.

The Indian subcontinent too was conquered not by the British state, but by the
mercenary army of the British East India Company. This company outperformed even
the VOC. From its headquarters in Leadenhall Street, London, it ruled a mighty
Indian empire for about a century, maintaining a huge military force of up to
350,000 soldiers, considerably outnumbering the armed forces of the British
monarchy.

Only in 1858 did the British crown nationalise India along with the company’s
private army.

Napoleon made fun of the British, calling them a nation of shopkeepers.

Yet these shopkeepers defeated Napoleon himself, and their empire was the
largest the world has ever seen.

The nationalisation of Indonesia by the Dutch crown (1800) and of India by the
British crown (1858) hardly ended the embrace of capitalism and empire.

Joint-stock companies no longer needed to establish and govern private colonies
– their managers and large shareholders now pulled the strings of power in
London, Amsterdam and Paris, and they could count on the state to look after
their interests.

The most notorious example of how governments did the bidding of big money was
the First Opium War, fought between Britain and China (1840–42).

In the first half of the nineteenth century, the British East India Company and
sundry British business people made fortunes by exporting drugs, particularly
opium, to China.

In the late 1830s the Chinese government issued a ban on drug trafficking, but
British drug merchants simply ignored the law. Chinese authorities began to
confiscate and destroy drug cargos.

The drug cartels had close connections in Westminster and Downing Street – many
MPs and Cabinet ministers in fact held stock in the drug companies – so they
pressured the government to take action.

In 1840 Britain duly declared war on China in the name of ‘free trade’.

Under the subsequent peace treaty, China agreed not to constrain the activities
of British drug merchants and to compensate them for damages inflicted by the
Chinese police.

Furthermore, the British demanded and received control of Hong Kong, which they
proceeded to use as a secure base for drug trafficking (Hong Kong remained in
British hands until 1997).

In the late nineteenth century, about 40 million Chinese, a tenth of the
country’s population, were opium addicts.3

These were hardly the only wars fought in the interests of investors. In fact,
war itself could become a commodity, just like opium.

In 1821 the Greeks rebelled against the Ottoman Empire.

But London financiers saw an opportunity as well. They proposed to the rebel
leaders the issue of tradable Greek Rebellion Bonds on the London stock
exchange. The Greeks would promise to repay the bonds, plus interest, if and
when they won their independence.

The Turks gradually gained the upper hand. With a rebel defeat imminent, the
bondholders faced the prospect of losing their trousers. The bondholders’
interest was the national interest, so the British organised an international
fleet that, in 1827, sank the main Ottoman flotilla in the Battle of Navarino.

After centuries of subjugation, Greece was finally free. But freedom came with a
huge debt that the new country had no way of repaying. The Greek economy was
mortgaged to British creditors for decades to come.

After the Battle of Navarino, British capitalists were more willing to invest
their money in risky overseas deals. They had seen that if a foreign debtor
refused to repay loans, Her Majesty’s army would get their money back.

At the end of the Middle Ages, slavery was almost unknown in Christian Europe.

From the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries, about 10 million African slaves
were imported to America.

Private slave-trading companies sold shares on the Amsterdam, London and Paris
stock exchanges.

Only forty years passed between the moment Einstein determined that any kind of
mass could be converted into energy – that’s what E = mc² means – and the moment
atom bombs obliterated Hiroshima and Nagasaki and nuclear power stations
mushroomed all over the globe.

Petroleum had been known for thousands of years, and was used to waterproof
roofs and lubricate axles. Yet until just a century ago nobody thought it was
useful for much more than that.

Every few decades we discover a new energy source, so that the sum total of
energy at our disposal just keeps growing.

Only a tiny proportion of the sun’s energy reaches us, yet it amounts to
3,766,800 exajoules of energy each year (a joule is a unit of energy in the
metric system, about the amount you expend to lift a small apple one yard
straight up; an exajoule is a billion billion joules – that’s a lot of apples).

All the world’s plants capture only about 3,000 of those solar exajoules through
the process of photosynthesis.3

All human activities and industries put together consume about 500 exajoules
annually, equivalent to the amount of energy earth receives from the sun in just
ninety minutes.4

Chemists discovered aluminium only in the 1820s, but separating the metal from
its ore was extremely difficult and costly.

For decades, aluminium was much more expensive than gold.

In the 1860s, Emperor Napoleon III of France commissioned aluminium cutlery to
be laid out for his most distinguished guests. Less important visitors had to
make do with the gold knives and forks.5

But at the end of the nineteenth century chemists discovered a way to extract
immense amounts of cheap aluminium, and current global production stands at 30
million tons per year.

Around the time that Homo sapiens was elevated to divine status by humanist
religions, farm animals stopped being viewed as living creatures that could feel
pain and distress, and instead came to be treated as machines.

Many dairy cows live almost all their allotted years inside a small enclosure;
standing, sitting and sleeping in their own urine and excrement.

Chicks on a conveyor belt in a commercial hatchery. Male chicks and imperfect
female chicks are picked off the conveyor belt and are then asphyxiated in gas
chambers, dropped into automatic shredders, or simply thrown into the rubbish,
where they are crushed to death. Hundreds of millions of chicks die each year in
such hatcheries.

The tragedy of industrial agriculture is that it takes great care of the
objective needs of animals, while neglecting their subjective needs.

The modern capitalist economy must constantly increase production if it is to
survive, like a shark that must swim or suffocate. Yet it’s not enough just to
produce. Somebody must also buy the products, or industrialists and investors
alike will go bust.

Consumerism has worked very hard, with the help of popular psychology (‘Just do
it!’) to convince people that indulgence is good for you, whereas frugality is
self-oppression.

Each year the US population spends more money on diets than the amount needed to
feed all the hungry people in the rest of the world.

There are about 80,000 giraffes in the world, compared to 1.5 billion cattle;
only 200,000 wolves, compared to 400 million domesticated dogs; only 250,000
chimpanzees – in contrast to billions of humans. Humankind really has taken over
the world.1

The future may see Sapiens gaining control of a cornucopia of new materials and
energy sources, while simultaneously destroying what remains of the natural
habitat and driving most other species to extinction.

If a lost time traveller popped up in a medieval village and asked a passerby,
‘What year is this?’ the villager would be as bewildered by the question as by
the stranger’s ridiculous clothing.

Finally, in 1880, the British government took the unprecedented step of
legislating that all timetables in Britain must follow Greenwich.

For the first time in history, a country adopted a national time and obliged its
population to live according to an artificial clock rather than local ones or
sunrise-to-sunset cycles.

Each news programme opened with a live broadcast of Big Ben tolling the hour –
the magical sound of freedom. Ingenious German physicists found a way to
determine the weather conditions in London based on tiny differences in the tone
of the broadcast ding-dongs.

When neighbours in a high-rise apartment building cannot even agree on how much
to pay their janitor, how can we expect them to resist the state?

Even more money is transferred to the bank accounts of fashion designers, gym
managers, dieticians, cosmeticians and plastic surgeons, who help us arrive at
the café looking as similar as possible to the market’s ideal of beauty.

Consumerism and nationalism work extra hours to make us imagine that millions of
strangers belong to the same community as ourselves, that we all have a common
past, common interests and a common future. This isn’t a lie. It’s imagination.

As long as millions of Germans believe in the existence of a German nation, get
excited at the sight of German national symbols, retell German national myths,
and are willing to sacrifice money, time and limbs for the German nation,
Germany will remain one of the strongest powers in the world.

The nation does its best to hide its imagined character. Most nations argue that
they are a natural and eternal entity, created in some primordial epoch by
mixing the soil of the motherland with the blood of the people.

Most existing nations evolved only after the Industrial Revolution.

The Syrian, Lebanese, Jordanian and Iraqi nations are the product of haphazard
borders drawn in the sand by French and British diplomats who ignored local
history, geography and economy.

In the year 2000, wars caused the deaths of 310,000 individuals, and violent
crime killed another 520,000.

Yet from a macro perspective these 830,000 victims comprised only 1.5 per cent
of the 56 million people who died in 2000.

That year 1.26 million people died in car accidents (2.25 per cent of total
mortality) and 815,000 people committed suicide (1.45 per cent).

The figures for 2002 are even more surprising. Out of 57 million dead, only
172,000 people died in war and 569,000 died of violent crime (a total of 741,000
victims of human violence). In contrast, 873,000 people committed suicide.

It turns out that in the year following the 9/11 attacks, despite all the talk
of terrorism and war, the average person was more likely to kill himself than to
be killed by a terrorist, a soldier or a drug dealer.

Today the global average is only nine murders a year per 100,000 people, and
most of these murders take place in weak states such as Somalia and Colombia.

In the centralised states of Europe, the average is one murder a year per
100,000 people.7

At least some of the praise usually heaped on Mahatma Gandhi for his non-violent
creed is actually owed to the British Empire. Despite many years of bitter and
often violent struggle, when the end of the Raj came, the Indians did not have
to fight the British in the streets of Delhi and Calcutta.

Since 1945, no independent country recognised by the UN has been conquered and
wiped off the map. Limited international wars still occur from time to time, and
millions still die in wars, but wars are no longer the norm.

We seldom think of the Arab world as particularly peaceful. Yet only once since
the Arab countries won their independence has one of them mounted a full-scale
invasion of another (the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990).

There have been quite a few border clashes (e.g. Syria vs Jordan in 1970), many
armed interventions of one in the affairs of another (e.g. Syria in Lebanon),
numerous civil wars (Algeria, Yemen, Libya) and an abundance of coups and
revolts.

Since African states won their independence in the 1960s and 1970s, very few
countries have invaded one another in the hope of conquest.

The Nobel Peace Prize to end all peace prizes should have been given to Robert
Oppenheimer and his fellow architects of the atomic bomb.

Nuclear weapons have turned war between superpowers into collective suicide, and
made it impossible to seek world domination by force of arms.

Nothing in the comfortable lives of the urban middle class can approach the wild
excitement and sheer joy experienced by a forager band on a successful mammoth
hunt.

The majority of humans began to enjoy the fruits of modern medicine no earlier
than 1850, and the drastic drop in child mortality is a twentieth-century
phenomenon.

Mass famines continued to blight much of humanity up to the middle of the
twentieth century.

During Communist China’s Great Leap Forward of 1958–61, somewhere between 10 and
50 million human beings starved to death.

If we accept a mere tenth of what animal-rights activists are claiming, then
modern industrial agriculture might well be the greatest crime in history.

People are made happy by one thing and one thing only – pleasant sensations in
their bodies.

Happiness and misery play a role in evolution only to the extent that they
encourage or discourage survival and reproduction.

We tend to believe that if we could just change our workplace, get married,
finish writing that novel, buy a new car or repay the mortgage, we would be on
top of the world. Yet when we get what we desire we don’t seem to be any
happier.

Today, when we finally realise that the keys to happiness are in the hands of
our biochemical system, we can stop wasting our time on politics and social
reforms, putsches and ideologies, and focus instead on the only thing that can
make us truly happy: manipulating our biochemistry.

As Nietzsche put it, if you have a why to live, you can bear almost any how. A
meaningful life can be extremely satisfying even in the midst of hardship,
whereas a meaningless life is a terrible ordeal no matter how comfortable it is.

As far as we can tell, from a purely scientific viewpoint, human life has
absolutely no meaning.

Humans are the outcome of blind evolutionary processes that operate without goal
or purpose.

Our actions are not part of some divine cosmic plan, and if planet Earth were to
blow up tomorrow morning, the universe would probably keep going about its
business as usual.

Hence any meaning that people ascribe to their lives is just a delusion.

So perhaps happiness is synchronising one’s personal delusions of meaning with
the prevailing collective delusions.

As long as my personal narrative is in line with the narratives of the people
around me, I can convince myself that my life is meaningful, and find happiness
in that conviction.

Liberal politics is based on the idea that the voters know best, and there is no
need for Big Brother to tell us what is good for us.

Liberal art declares that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

Students in liberal schools and universities are taught to think for themselves.

From a Christian viewpoint, the vast majority of people are in more or less the
same situation as heroin addicts.

A microorganism belonging to one species can incorporate genetic codes from a
completely different species into its cell and thereby gain new capabilities,
such as resistance to antibiotics.

Biological engineering is deliberate human intervention on the biological level
(e.g. implanting a gene) aimed at modifying an organism’s shape, capabilities,
needs or desires, in order to realise some preconceived cultural idea, such as
the artistic predilections of Eduardo Kac.

Humans also castrated their own young males to create soprano singers with
enchanting voices and eunuchs who could safely be entrusted with overseeing the
sultan’s harem.

For example, lines of E. coli, a bacterium that lives symbiotically in the human
gut (and which makes headlines when it gets out of the gut and causes deadly
infections), have been genetically engineered to produce biofuel.2

E. coli and several species of fungi have also been engineered to produce
insulin, thereby lowering the cost of diabetes treatment.3

A gene extracted from an Arctic fish has been inserted into potatoes, making the
plants more frost-resistant.4

Professor George Church of Harvard University recently suggested that, with the
completion of the Neanderthal Genome Project, we can now implant reconstructed
Neanderthal DNA into a Sapiens ovum, thus producing the first Neanderthal child
in 30,000 years.

Church claimed that he could do the job for a paltry $30 million. Several women
have already volunteered to serve as surrogate mothers.10

(The mouse genome contains about 2.5 billion nucleobases, the Sapiens genome
about 2.9 billion bases – meaning the latter is only 14 per cent larger.)

The Cognitive Revolution that turned Homo sapiens from an insignificant ape into
the master of the world did not require any noticeable change in physiology or
even in the size and external shape of the Sapiens brain.

It apparently involved no more than a few small changes to internal brain
structure.

Perhaps another small change would be enough to ignite a Second Cognitive
Revolution, create a completely new type of consciousness, and transform Homo
sapiens into something altogether different.

Tinkering with our genes won’t necessarily kill us. But we might fiddle with
Homo sapiens to such an extent that we would no longer be Homo sapiens.

Retina Implant, a government-sponsored German company, is developing a retinal
prosthesis that may allow blind people to gain partial vision.

At present the technology allows patients to orientate themselves in space,
identify letters, and even recognise faces.15

Many programmers dream of creating a program that could learn and evolve
completely independently of its creator.

The Human Brain Project, founded in 2005, hopes to recreate a complete human
brain inside a computer, with electronic circuits in the computer emulating
neural networks in the brain.

Mapping the first human genome required fifteen years and $3 billion.

Today you can map a person’s DNA within a few weeks and at the cost of a few
hundred dollars.20

The era of personalised medicine – medicine that matches treatment to DNA – has
begun.

Throughout history, the upper classes always claimed to be smarter, stronger and
generally better than the underclass. They were usually deluding themselves.

A baby born to a poor peasant family was likely to be as intelligent as the
crown prince. With the help of new medical capabilities, the pretensions of the
upper classes might soon become an objective reality.

Physicists define the Big Bang as a singularity. It is a point at which all the
known laws of nature did not exist. Time too did not exist. It is thus
meaningless to say that anything existed ‘before’ the Big Bang.

We may be fast approaching a new singularity, when all the concepts that give
meaning to our world – me, you, men, women, love and hate – will become
irrelevant. Anything happening beyond that point is meaningless to us.

Unless some nuclear or ecological catastrophe intervenes, so goes the story, the
pace of technological development will soon lead to the replacement of Homo
sapiens by completely different beings who possess not only different physiques,
but also very different cognitive and emotional worlds.

We seek comfort in the fantasy that Dr Frankenstein can create only terrible
monsters, whom we would have to destroy in order to save the world.

We like to tell the story that way because it implies that we are the best of
all beings, that there never was and never will be something better than us.

Any attempt to improve us will inevitably fail, because even if our bodies might
be improved, you cannot touch the human spirit.

When the nuclear age erupted in the 1940s, many forecasts were made about the
future nuclear world of the year 2000.

When sputnik and Apollo II fired the imagination of the world, everyone began
predicting that by the end of the century, people would be living in space
colonies on Mars and Pluto.

On the other hand, nobody foresaw the Internet.

What we should take seriously is the idea that the next stage of history will
include not only technological and organisational transformations, but also
fundamental transformations in human consciousness and identity.

After all, today’s debate between today’s religions, ideologies, nations and
classes will in all likelihood disappear along with Homo sapiens.

If our successors indeed function on a different level of consciousness (or
perhaps possess something beyond consciousness that we cannot even conceive), it
seems doubtful that Christianity or Islam will be of interest to them, that
their social organisation could be Communist or capitalist, or that their
genders could be male or female.

The only thing we can try to do is to influence the direction scientists are
taking. But since we might soon be able to engineer our desires too, the real
question facing us is not ‘What do we want to become?’, but ‘What do we want to
want?’ Those who are not spooked by this question probably haven’t given it
enough thought.

SEVENTY THOUSAND YEARS AGO, HOMO sapiens was still an insignificant animal
minding its own business in a corner of Africa.

In the following millennia it transformed itself into the master of the entire
planet and the terror of the ecosystem.

Today it stands on the verge of becoming a god, poised to acquire not only
eternal youth, but also the divine abilities of creation and destruction.

Unfortunately, the Sapiens regime on earth has so far produced little that we
can be proud of.

Time and again, massive increases in human power did not necessarily improve the
well-being of individual Sapiens, and usually caused immense misery to other
animals.

We are more powerful than ever before, but have very little idea what to do with
all that power. Worse still, humans seem to be more irresponsible than ever.

Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who
don’t know what they want?
