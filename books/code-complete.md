### Chapter 32: Self Documenting Code

> Don't document bad code - rewrite it.

**The Elements of Programming Style** by Kernighan & Plauger (1978)

### Chapter 33.3 Curiosity

> The worst code I've ever seen was written by someone who wouldn't let anyone go near her programs. Finally, her manager threatened to fire her if she didn't cooperate. Her code was uncommented and littered with variables like `x`, `xx`, `xxx`, `xx1`, and, `xx2`, all of which were global. Her manager's boss thought she was a great programmer because she fixed errors quickly. The quality of her code gave her abundant opportunities to demonstrate her error-correcting ability.

> It's no sin to be a beginner or an intermediate. It's no sin to be a competent programmer instead of a leader. The sin is in how long you remain a beginner or intermediate after you know what you have to do to improve.
