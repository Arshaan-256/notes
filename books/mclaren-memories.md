# McLaren Memories: A Biography of Bruce McLaren

*Eoin Young*

* In his entire career, Bruce only had two accidents that hurt him. Neither of
  them was his fault and the last one killed him. The first was in the 1963
  German Grand Prix. He had qualified on the second row and made a strong
  start, but on the fourth lap he crashed heavily and woke up in nearby Adenau
  hospital.

  A check of the wreckage back in Surbiton showed that the right rear wishbone
  had broken and the car had turned suddenly left at 100 mph.

  "After my crash at the 'Ring I had thought hard about my future. *I had once
  promised myself to give up racing after my first big shunt*, but I realise
  now that would have been the worst possible thing I could have done. It's
  essential to go straight out again and have a go, if you are ever going to
  look yourself in the eye again."
* "The news that he had died instantly was a terrible shock to all of us, but
  who is to say that he had not seen more, done more and learned more in his
  twenty-six years than many people do in a lifetime? To do something well is
  so worthwhile that to die trying to do it better cannot be foolhardy. *It
  would be a waste of life to do nothing with one's ability, for I feel that
  life is measured in achievement, not in years alone.*" (Written at the *From
  the Cockpit* column after Timmy Mayer's death in 1964)
* What may have been a black cloud on the McLaren sports car racing horizon
  actually turned out to be one of Colin Chapman's rare flawed designs,
  flattered only by Clark's skill in the silk purse department.
* Howden Ganley had raced a Lotus Eleven in New Zealand and he was amazed and
  delighted when, for the first test with the modified Tasman car at Goodwood,
  Bruce suggested that he bring his helmet so that he could try the car.

  "How many employers would do that for you? He had that way of getting you to
  want to give 100 per cent effort all the time, and to continually lift your
  game. A small group of people all pulling together, led by Bruce, one of the
  nicest, most charismatic people I have ever had the privilege of knowing."
* 'I've often said that if Bruce came into the workshop one morning and said,
  "OK guys, today we are going to walk across the Sahara desert," there would
  have been no moaning and complaining. The response would have been, "OK
  Bruce, when do we start? Let's get going..."'
* The Wigram event (1968) changed the face of racing. Jim Clark's Lotus
  appeared in the bright new colours of Player's Gold Leaf tobacco.instead of
  its traditional green with yellow stripe. Commercial sponsorship of motor
  sport became a reality that weekend.
* "[...] When I got home I learned the crash had been fatal. I was stunned.
  Jimmy ranked with, perhaps even outranked, Nuvolari, Fangio and Moss, and
  I think we all felt that in a way he was invincible. To be killed in an
  accident with a Formula 2 car on a straight is almost unacceptable. But
  tragically it's true." (McLaren on Clark's death)
* '[...] The engine was designed back in 1931 and our drawing office was so
  proud of their new aluminium monocoque chassis, which finishes just in front
  of the engine, that there was dark talk of sticking a little sign on the
  chassis at that point worded *"1970 Stops Here!"*' (McLaren on the
  Offenhauser engine of the McLaren Indy 500 project)
* "Unfortunately, my basic caution has stayed with me from those early days,
  when to shunt the car would have meant the end of my motor racing. I know
  I am considered to be the perfect Number 2 in a team, the eternal runner-up.
  That aggravates me. I'd much rather win, of course, but the ability isn't
  always there. Sometimes it is, sometimes I can do it. I wish I could do it
  *all* the time, but I have no illusions. I know I can't. Andretti, Stewart
  and Rindt all seem to be able to faster than I can, most of the time. Denny
  can go faster than I can. He used not to be able to, he certainly can now. He
  seems more on form than he used to be. He's just plain better. Jack Brabham
  is amazing - he has this tramendous ability to put one great lap together."
