# McLaren Memories: A Biography of Bruce McLaren

*Eoin Young*

* In his entire career, Bruce only had two accidents that hurt him. Neither of
  them was his fault and the last one killed him. The first was in the 1963
  German Grand Prix. He had qualified on the second row and made a strong
  start, but on the fourth lap he crashed heavily and woke up in nearby Adenau
  hospital.

  A check of the wreckage back in Surbiton showed that the right rear wishbone
  had broken and the car had turned suddenly left at 100 mph.

  "After my crash at the 'Ring I had thought hard about my future. *I had once
  promised myself to give up racing after my first big shunt*, but I realise
  now that would have been the worst possible thing I could have done. It's
  essential to go straight out again and have a go, if you are ever going to
  look yourself in the eye again."
* "The news that he had died instantly was a terrible shock to all of us, but
  who is to say that he had not seen more, done more and learned more in his
  twenty-six years than many people do in a lifetime? To do something well is
  so worthwhile that to die trying to do it better cannot be foolhardy. *It
  would be a waste of life to do nothing with one's ability, for I feel that
  life is measured in achievement, not in years alone.*" (Written at the *From
  the Cockpit* column after Timmy Mayer's death in 1964)
* What may have been a black cloud on the McLaren sports car racing horizon
  actually turned out to be one of Colin Chapman's rare flawed designs,
  flattered only by Clark's skill in the silk purse department.
* Howden Ganley had raced a Lotus Eleven in New Zealand and he was amazed and
  delighted when, for the first test with the modified Tasman car at Goodwood,
  Bruce suggested that he bring his helmet so that he could try the car.

  "How many employers would do that for you? He had that way of getting you to
  want to give 100 per cent effort all the time, and to continually lift your
  game. A small group of people all pulling together, led by Bruce, one of the
  nicest, most charismatic people I have ever had the privilege of knowing."
* 'I've often said that if Bruce came into the workshop one morning and said,
  "OK guys, today we are going to walk across the Sahara desert," there would
  have been no moaning and complaining. The response would have been, "OK
  Bruce, when do we start? Let's get going..."'
