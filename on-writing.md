## Ursula K. Le Guin

* Try writing very short pieces, a paragraph, a page, not complete
  stories. Just describe a certain scene, or put a character into a
  situation of some kind and tell what they do, what they feel.
* [...] you need to know where your story is going, in a general way,
  before you begin writing it. But I don’t advise thinking of the end
  of the story as a "target." You aren't shooting at something.
  You’re making something.
* How can you judge how well the first page of a story works until
  you've done a first draft of the whole story? There’s no way you
  can tell until the whole thing is, however roughly, there.

  And then, more often than not, you find the first page, the first
  several pages, are just throat-clearings. Necessary preliminaries.
  Clearing stuff out of the way. Circling around, nose to ground…
  till finally you pick up the scent and you're off into your story
  like a bloodhound on the track.

  So then when you revise you throw away the whole beginning.

  If you don't trust me, trust Chekhov. He said you can always throw
  away the first three pages of a first draft. I didn't believe him
  till I tried it.
* [...] writing a short story is very different from writing a novel,
  but the activities aren’t totally unrelated. Sometimes novels grow
  from short stories. (See Dreamsnake.) Or the same characters or the
  same location begin to turn up in different stories, till you have
  a novel made out of stories (see The Country of the Pointed Firs,
  or Cloud Atlas).
* If kind of knowing where you want to go isn’t enough, if you’re
  really uneasy not knowing every step of the way, then try sketching
  out a rough story-line. Don’t rush it. Take time over it. Make notes,
  make other notes. Let ideas arise, and maybe sink again. Think
  about the story when you’re going to sleep, or even better when
  you’re waking up. The story needs you to tell it. Don’t worry about
  its purpose, that will probably look after itself. Be patient with
  yourself and your story. Trust it to take you where you both want
  to go.

## George Orwell

* A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself
  at least four questions, thus: What am I trying to say? What words will
  express it? What image or idiom will make it clearer? Is this image fresh
  enough to have an effect? And he will probably ask himself two more:
  Could I put it more shortly? Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly?
* Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used
  to seeing in print.
* Never use a long word where a short one will do.
* If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
* Never use the passive where you can use the active.
* Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can
  think of an everyday English equivalent.
* Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.
