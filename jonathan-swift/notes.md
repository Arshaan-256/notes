## Jonathan Swift's Religious Beliefs

*David Cody, Associate Professor of English, Hartwick College*

Swift was a clergyman, a member of the Church of Ireland, the Irish branch of
the Anglican Church; and as such he was a militant defender of his church (and
his own career prospects) in the face of the threats to its continued existence
posed by Roman Catholicism at home in Ireland (which was overwhelmingly
Catholic) and in England, where Swift and his peers saw the Catholics (and, at
the other religious and political extreme, the Dissenters) as threatening not
only the Anglican Church but the English Constitution.

Swift was ostensibly a conservative by nature: he instinctively sought stability
in religion as in politics, but stability which insured personal
freedoms. Indeed, so far as he was concerned, religion, morality, and politics
were inseparable: he consistently attacked theological attempts (even within
Anglicanism itself) to define and limit orthodoxy — attempts which, he felt, led
ultimately to anarchic dissent. The divisive tendencies of Mankind had, he
believed, over the centuries, promoted the general decay of Christianity itself,
which had lost its original clarity, simplicity, and coherence. The Truth had
been mishandled, corrupted, by men who had behaved like Yahoos. He adhered to
the tenets of the Anglican Church because he had been brought up to respect
them, because the Church of Ireland was the church of his social class, and
because his own ambitions were involved in its success, but also because he saw
the Church as a force for rationality and moderation; as occupying a perilous
middle ground between the opposing adherents of Rome and Geneva.

Underlying all of Swift's religious concerns, underlying his apparent
conservatism, which was really a form of radicalism, was his belief that in Man
God had created an animal which was not inherently rational but only capable, on
occasion, of behaving reasonably: only, as he put it, rationis capax. It is our
tendency to disappoint, in this respect, that he rages against: his works embody
his attempts to maintain order and reason in a world which tended toward chaos
and disorder, and he concerned himself more with the concrete social, political,
and moral aspects of human nature than with the abstractions of philosophy,
theology, and metaphysics.

## Jonathan Swift's Style

Swift's style is, in its line, perfect; the manner is a complete expression of
the matter, the terms appropriate, and the artifice concealed. It is simplicity
in the true sense of the word.

*(Samuel Taylor Coleridge, "Lecture on Style," 1818)*

Swift's style seems so simple that one would think any child might write as he
does, and yet if we try we find to our despair that it is impossible.

*(Sir Walter Scott, The Cambridge History of English and American Literature)*

### Some advice from Swift

tl;dr: *Keep it simple*, put *proper words in proper places*.

Two things I will just warn you against: the first is, the frequency of flat
unnecessary epithets; and the other is, the folly of using old threadbare
phrases, which will often make you go out of your way to find and apply them,
are nauseous to rational hearers, and will seldom express your meaning as well
as your own natural words.

When a man's thoughts are clear, the properest words will generally offer
themselves first, and his own judgment will direct him in what order to place
them so as they may be best understood.

*(From "Letter to a Young Gentleman Lately Entered Into Holy Orders", 1721)*

One of the main reasons is that Swift wrote in a very plain and downright
style. He didn't use any embellishments. At times, when Swift was writing
serious stuff this same plain style appears dry but when writing humorously,
this same plainness gives his wit a singular edge. Swift didn't use ornate or
rhetorical language; he said what he had to in simply without any affectation as
Hugh Blair says:

"His style is of the plain and simple kind; free of all affectation, and all
superfluity; perspicuous, manly and pure."

Another important feature of Swift's prose is that he uses the common touch. In
other words, everybody can understand his language that is why even children can
read his books with so much enjoyment. Also, Swift addresses people as rational
and political beings, making them his equals.

* "Kanunlar örümcek ağına benzer. Onlar nasıl yalnız küçük sinekleri tutar da,
  arıları ve eşek arılarını yakalayamazlarsa, yasalar da aynı, küçük suçları
  tutar, fakat büyüklerini serbest bırakır."
* "without one word of cupid's darts,  
  of killing eyes, or bleeding hearts;  
  with friendship and esteem possessed,  
  i ne'er admitted love a guest." [1]
* Violent friendship is much more lasting and as much engaging as violent love.

1. "cupid'in okları olmadan,  
   öldürücü gözleri, ya da kanayan kalbi;  
   dostluk ve saygı bana öylesine egemendi;  
   aşkı hiçbir zaman konuk etmedim benliğime."
2. Siddetli (yoğun) bir dostluk, şiddetli bir aşktan daha uzun sürer ve insanı
   aşk kadar sarar.
