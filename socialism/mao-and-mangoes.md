Throughout the spring and summer of 1968, competing student groups loyal to Mao
engaged in bloody clashes. Mao asked 30,000 Beijing factory workers to act as
peacekeepers, and many of these were killed or injured.

In the middle of an uneasy peace, Mao received a crate of mangoes from the
Pakistani foreign minister, who was visiting Beijing. Mao regifted the fruit to
the factory workers’ peacekeeping squads—who were now calling themselves “The
Worker-Peasant Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams”—in thanks for their
efforts.

Workers saw the mango as an indication of Mao’s care for the working class. The
crate of mangoes was split up and individual fruits were sent to factories.
There they were put on altars, sealed in wax, pickled in formaldehyde, and (in
at least one factory) boiled in water, of which each worker drank a symbolic
spoonful.

Copies of mangoes in wax and plastic were produced so that the symbol could be
more widely distributed. Many plastic or wax replicas were enclosed in vitrines
to emphasize their status a quasi-sacred object. Mango objects—trays, mugs,
fabric—joined the replicas. The state even produced Mango Brand cigarettes.

After Mao’s death in 1976, and especially after the Party issued a critique of
his methods in 1981, the mango lost its cultural power, and some Chinese
started throwing their wax mangoes in the trash.
