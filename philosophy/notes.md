## Cartesian dualism

Cartesian (or substance) dualism is the idea that the mind is made of a
fundamentally different substance to the body.

The mind is made of immaterial stuff and the body is made of material stuff.

Material substances -> Have extension.

Extension = occupies a certain amount of space.

Immaterial substances -> Do not have extension

According to Cartesian dualism, minds are made of immaterial ‘thinking’
substance which does not occupy a place in space. The part of me that
thinks exists independently of the body.

### Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia & the problem of causation

Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia was one of Descartes pupils. She pointed
out that physical things can only be changed by interaction with other
physical things. If the mind is immaterial (i.e. not physical) then how can
it instigate changes in the body, which are physical?

## Identity theory

Physicalism is the view that all that exists is physical stuff, that is, stuff
which has extension. Therefore, whatever our explanation of mental
phenomena is, it can’t go around citing immaterial stuff! This gets around
the problem of causation, because if mental phenomena consist in
physical stuff, just like our bodies, then they can interact with our bodies
to cause various behaviours.

On one view of physicalism mental phenomena, like thoughts and
emotions etc., are identical with certain physical phenomena, e.g. a
cocktail of chemicals in our heads. This is known as the identity theory.

The identity theory of physicalism with regards to mental states claims
that having a mental state consists in being in a particular physical state.

For example, being in pain is identical to your C-fibres firing and there is
nothing else to it than that.

Identity theory is a reductive account of mental states: it is reducing them
to physical processes.

Type-identity[1] theory claims that for every type of mental phenomenon
(feeling sad; feeling happy; wanting something or hating something) there
is a corresponding physical state.

[1] Strictly speaking ‘type-type’ identity theory because it says types of
mental phenomena are identical with types of physical phenomena.

So pains are identical with C-fibre
activation: my pain is identical with my C-fibres activation, and your pain
is identical with your C-fibres activation; my pain now is identical with
C-fibre activation and my pain yesterday lunch time was also identical with
the activity of my C-fibres.

By contrast, token-identity theorists say that my pain yesterday was
definitely identical with a physical state. And my pain today is definitely
identical with a physical state. And your pain is identical with a physical
state. But these physical states might all be different: the first might be
neuron 24 firing, whilst the second is neuron 408 firing. All the
token-identity theorist is committed to is that every mental phenomenon is
identical with some physical phenomenon.

### A problem for type- identity theory

Hilary Putnam, in his 1967 paper ‘The Nature of Mental States’ raised the
following objection to type-identity theory, arguing that it is too narrow.

Imagine that we find the cocktail of chemicals which we are certain is
type-identical to the mental state of feeling pain. Putnam says that all
we’ve done is find out the identity relation between pain and its physical
realisation in humans.

Let’s say, for the sake of argument, that octopus
brains are made up of totally different chemicals to human brains, but
that we have good reason to believe that these critters feel pain, e.g. they
withdraw from hot stimuli, they engage in avoidance behaviour around
those stimuli, we see a spike in their brain activity when they touch hot
things. Do we want to deny them pain because their brains are made up
of different stuff to ours? Of course not, says Putnam.

### Multiple realisability

The key point for Putnam is that mental states are multiply realisable. This
just means that any mental state, e.g. the mental state of wanting a
pet beaver, can be instantiated in a variety of different physical systems.
It could be in a physical system made out of H2O and other chemicals
(like us) or a system made out of something totally different, like the
chemicals in an octopus brain.

Currency is thus multiply realisable: there are lots of different things that
are currency in different cultures, but they all share a common role.


## Functionalism

Putnam’s insight had a considerable impact on contemporary philosophy
of mind. He was saying that rather than thinking about mental
phenomena in terms of what they might be made of physically (because
this leads to all sorts of problems when it comes to non-humans) we
should be thinking about them in terms of what they do.

Putnam’s big claim was that we should identify mental states not by what
they’re made of, but by what they do. And what mental states do is they
are caused by sensory stimuli and current mental states and cause
behaviour and new mental states.
